The advent of new technologies for molecular and morphological data acquisition and analysis, allied to the integration of knowledge from different areas, such as ecology and population genetics, allows for the emergence of more rigorous, accurate and complete scientific hypothesis on species diversity. Mustached bats (genus Pteronotus) are a good model for the application of this integrative approach. They are a widely distributed and a morphologically homogeneous group, but comprising species with remarkable differences in their echolocation strategy and feeding behavior. The latest systematic review suggested six species with 17 subspecies in Pteronotus. Subsequent studies using discrete morphological characters supported the same arrangement. However, recent papers reported high levels of genetic divergence among conspecific taxa followed by bioacoustic and geographic agreement, suggesting an underestimated diversity in the genus. To date, no study merging genetic evidences and morphometric variation along the entire geographic range of this group has been attempted. Based on a comprehensive sampling including representatives of all current taxonomic units, we attempt to delimit species in Pteronotus through the application of multiple methodologies and hierarchically distinct datasets. The molecular approach includes six molecular markers from three genetic transmission systems; morphological investigations used 41 euclidean distances estimated through three-dimensional landmarks collected from 1628 skulls. The phylogenetic analysis reveals a greater diversity than previously reported, with a high correspondence among the genetic lineages and the currently recognized subspecies in the genus. Discriminant analysis of variables describing size and shape of cranial bones support the rising of the genetic groups to the specific status. Based on multiples evidences, we present an updated taxonomic arrangement composed by 16 extant species and a new and more robust phylogenetic hypothesis for the species included in the genus Pteronotus. Studies developed under such integrative taxonomic approach are timely for a deeper and wider comprehension of Neotropical diversity, representing the first step for answering broader questions on evolutionary and ecological aspects of Neotropical life history.","2016-10-01","2024-09-06 17:56:07","2024-09-06 17:56:14","2024-09-06 17:56:07","184-198","","","103","","Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","Integrating multiple evidences in taxonomy","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\AE5SLL5H\Pavan and Marroig - 2016 - Integrating multiple evidences in taxonomy species diversity and phylogeny of mustached bats (Mormo.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\N3KLVW97\S1055790316301580.html","","","Euclidean distances; Evolutionary history; Integrative taxonomy; Neotropical diversity; Phylogeny; Species tree","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many of the threats bats face (e.g., habitat loss, bushmeat hunting, and climate change) reflect the conservation challenges of our era. However, compared to other mammals and birds, we know significantly less about the population status of most bat species, which makes prioritizing and planning conservation actions challenging. Over a third of bat species assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are considered threatened or data deficient, and well over half of the species have unknown or decreasing population trends. That equals 988 species, or 80% of bats assessed by IUCN, needing conservation or research attention. Delivering conservation to bat species will require sustained efforts to assess population status and trends and address data deficiencies. Successful bat conservation must integrate research and conservation to identify stressors and their solutions and to test the efficacy of actions to stabilize or increase populations. Global and regional networks that connect researchers, conservation practitioners, and local stakeholders to share knowledge, build capacity, and prioritize and coordinate research and conservation efforts, are vital to ensuring sustainable bat populations worldwide.","2020-06","2024-01-09 23:26:41","2024-11-12 21:37:31","2024-01-09 23:26:41","5-25","","1","1469","","Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\C9YUYTYU\Frick et al. - 2020 - A review of the major threats and challenges to gl.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\WJBI2ZEF\Frick et al. - 2020 - A review of the major threats and challenges to gl.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\QULCL59S\Frick et al. - 2020 - A review of the major threats and challenges to global bat conservation.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\444QC496\nyas.html","","","conservation; biodiversity; mammals; Chiroptera; bats; threats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the context of climate change, there is evidence that some bat species are increasing their body size via phenotypic responses to higher temperatures at maternity roosts. To test the generality of this response, we conducted a >20-year study examining body size changes in 15 bat species in Italy, analysing data from 4393 individual bats captured since 1995. In addition to examining the temporal effect, we considered the potential influence of sexual dimorphism and, where relevant, included latitude and altitude as potential drivers of body size change. Contrary to initial predictions of a widespread increase in size, our findings challenge this assumption, revealing a nuanced interplay of factors contributing to the complexity of bat body size dynamics. Specifically, only three species (Myotis daubentonii, Nyctalus leisleri, and Pipistrellus pygmaeus) out of the 15 exhibited a discernible increase in body size over the studied period, prompting a reassessment of bats as reliable indicators of climate change based on alterations in body size. Our investigation into influencing factors highlighted the significance of temperature-related variables, with latitude and altitude emerging as crucial drivers. In some cases, this mirrored patterns consistent with Bergmann's rule, revealing larger bats recorded at progressively higher latitudes (Plecotus auritus, Myotis mystacinus, and Miniopterus schreibersii) or altitudes (Pipistrellus kuhlii). We also observed a clear sexual dimorphism effect in most species, with females consistently larger than males. The observed increase in size over time in three species suggests the occurrence of phenotypic plasticity, raising questions about potential long-term selective pressures on larger individuals. The unresolved question of whether temperature-related changes in body size reflect microevolutionary processes or phenotypic plastic responses adds further complexity to our understanding of body size patterns in bats over time and space.","2024","2024-10-17 21:25:04","2024-11-12 19:59:29","2024-10-17 21:25:04","e10872","","2","14","","","Climate is changing, are European bats too?","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Authors.

We reviewed the literature published during the last two decades and identified 283 relevant studies: 78 dealt with the control of potential insect pests by bats, 80 related to the suppression of other arthropods, 60 on the dispersal of native or endemic seeds, 11 dealt with the dispersal of seeds of introduced plants, 29 on the pollination of native or endemic plants, 1 study on pollination of introduced plants, and 24 on the use of guano as fertilizer. Our literature search showed that queries combining the terms “seed dispersal,” “insectivorous bats,” “nectarivorous bats,” “use of guano,” and “ecosystem services” returned 577 studies, but half were experimental in nature. We found that the evaluation of ecosystem services by bats has been mostly conducted in the Neotropical and Palearctic regions. To detect differences across relevant studies, and to explain trends in the study of ecosystem services provided by bats, we performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) fitted with a Poisson distribution to analyze potential differences among sampling methods. We identified 409 bat species that provide ecosystem services, 752 insect species consumed by bats and 549 plant species either dispersed or pollinated by bats. Our review summarizes the importance of conserving bat populations and the ecological services they provide, which is especially important during the current pandemic.","2022","2024-09-13 18:51:52","2024-11-12 19:59:27","2024-09-13 18:51:52","2-23","","1","17","","","Bats and their vital ecosystem services","","","","","","","en","© 2021 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1749-4877.12552","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\MZ84LK6J\Ramírez-Fráncel et al. - 2022 - Bats and their vital ecosystem services a global review.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RVCI94AY\Ramírez-Fráncel et al. - 2022 - Bats and their vital ecosystem services a global review.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\V78SDA7W\1749-4877.html","","","ecosystem services; chiroptera; frugivory; guano; insectivory; nectarivory; pest control; pollination; seed dispersal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In spite of this, information on their migration and dispersal patterns is limited.                                                     In temperate bats, migration is most evident in females. This reflects seasonal differences in their habitat requirements, and the fact that seasonally suitable sites can be geographically distant. Tropical bats mainly migrate to track variation in food availability.                                                     Little direct information is available on the patterns and drivers of bat dispersal, although drivers may include mate competition and inbreeding avoidance. In many temperate species, differential energy requirements and local resource competition among the sexes drive sexual segregation in the summer: females remain philopatric to their natal region, and frequently to their natal colony, while males disperse. In contrast, many tropical Pteropodidae form single‐male/multi‐female groups in which local resource defence contributes to female‐biased or all‐offspring dispersal from the natal site.                                                     Population genetic studies are the most common source of evidence used to infer the spatial dynamics of bats. As expected, migratory species tend to have less genetically structured populations over large geographical scales due to mating outside of breeding areas, weak migratory connectivity and long‐distance movements. In contrast and as expected, populations of sedentary species tend to be more differentiated at smaller geographical scales.                                                     Despite this general pattern, a range of factors, including historical events, dispersal capabilities, and behavioural, ecological and geographical barriers, are implicated in the genetic partitioning of bat populations, irrespective of movement patterns. These factors limit the study of bat movements using only genetic methods.

Economic valuation is conducted by measuring the human welfare gains or losses that result from changes in the provision of ecosystem services. Bats have long been postulated to play important roles in arthropod suppression, seed dispersal, and pollination; however, only recently have these ecosystem services begun to be thoroughly evaluated. Here, we review the available literature on the ecological and economic impact of ecosystem services provided by bats. We describe dietary preferences, foraging behaviors, adaptations, and phylogenetic histories of insectivorous, frugivorous, and nectarivorous bats worldwide in the context of their respective ecosystem services. For each trophic ensemble, we discuss the consequences of these ecological interactions on both natural and agricultural systems. Throughout this review, we highlight the research needed to fully determine the ecosystem services in question. Finally, we provide a comprehensive overview of economic valuation of ecosystem services. Unfortunately, few studies estimating the economic value of ecosystem services provided by bats have been conducted to date; however, we outline a framework that could be used in future studies to more fully address this question. Consumptive goods provided by bats, such as food and guano, are often exchanged in markets where the market price indicates an economic value. Nonmarket valuation methods can be used to estimate the economic value of nonconsumptive services, including inputs to agricultural production and recreational activities. Information on the ecological and economic value of ecosystem services provided by bats can be used to inform decisions regarding where and when to protect or restore bat populations and associated habitats, as well as to improve public perception of bats.","2011","2024-01-18 17:00:22","2024-01-18 17:00:25","2024-01-18 17:00:21","1-38","","1","1223","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2011 New York Academy of Sciences","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06004.x","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\FI4GNARA\Kunz et al. - 2011 - Ecosystem services provided by bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\INN2VTDW\j.1749-6632.2011.06004.html","","","insectivory; pollination; seed dispersal; arthropod suppression; biological pest control; ecosystem valuation; pesticide reduction; sustainable agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development and growth of global species’ trait databases are critical for improving trait-based analyses; however, it is vital to understand the gaps and biases in the available data. We reviewed bat wing morphology data, specifically mass, wingspan, wing area, wing loading, and aspect ratio, to identify issues with data reporting and ambiguity. Additionally, we aimed to assess taxonomic and geographic biases in trait data coverage. We found that most studies used similar field methodology, but that data reporting and quality were inconsistent/poor. Additionally, we noted several issues regarding semantic ambiguity in trait definitions, specifically around what constitutes wing area. Globally, we found that bat wing morphology trait coverage was low. Only six bat families had ≥40% trait coverage, and, of those, none consisted of more than 11 species in total. We found similar biases in trait coverage across International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categories, with threatened species having lower coverage. Geographically, North America, Europe, and the Indomalayan regions exhibited higher overall trait coverage, while both the Afrotropical and Neotropical ecoregions showed poor trait coverage. The underlying biases and gaps in bat wing morphology data have implications for researchers conducting global trait-based assessments. Implementing imputation techniques may address missing data, but only for smaller regional subsets with substantial trait coverage. Due to generally low overall trait coverage, increasing species’ representation in the database should be prioritised. We suggest adopting an Ecological Trait Standard Vocabulary to reduce semantic ambiguity in bat wing morphology traits, to improve data compilation and clarity. Additionally, we advocate that researchers adopt an Open Science approach to facilitate the growth of a bat wing morphology trait database.","2022","2024-01-15 17:24:49","2024-01-15 17:24:49","2024-01-15 17:24:49","165-176","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12270","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\YK5G98IL\mam.html; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Z92WUIKJ\Crane et al. - 2022 - Limitations and gaps in global bat wing morphology.pdf","","","aspect ratio; bats (Chiroptera); reproducibility; spatial biases; species’ traits; taxonomic biases; wing loading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the measures adopted to mitigate environmental contamination is the imposition of bans and restrictions to several chemical compounds. But are bans being efficient to reduce the amount of such chemicals in the environment? In this systematic review, we analyzed the efficacy of banning POPs using bats as biomonitors in terrestrial habitats. Although bats provide relevant ecosystem services, these animals are highly exposed to chemical organic pollutants such as POPs due to their feeding and behavioral habits. POP concentrations were observed in biological tissues of bats in the genus Myotis (United States), with levels decreasing over the years since the ban. We also noticed a shortage of studies in neotropical regions, where the information gap on several POPs in tropical systems is still a concern in terms of history and intensive use of these toxic chemicals. Few studies were found on emerging POPs or on POPs recently included in the Stockholm Convention. Besides, the specimens in the analyses in the studies reviewed were not separated by sex or age, which may conceal the potential risk of POPs to the conservation of bat populations. We recommend that future research extends beyond chronic POP contamination in bats to also include risk assessment trials, as wild populations may be affected in the long-term, as well as their role in the ecosystem and the economy, requiring long-term studies.","2024-07-01","2024-11-11 21:22:30","2024-11-11 21:22:30","2024-11-11 21:22:30","250-259","","3","22","","Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation","Is banning Persistent Organic Pollutants efficient?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RZ88L5A9\Monteiro-Alves et al. - 2024 - Is banning Persistent Organic Pollutants efficient A quantitative and qualitative systematic review.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\FYZLIN88\S253006442400035X.html","","","Mammalia; Chiroptera; Ecotoxicology; Organochlorine; Pesticide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bats are of particular interest for studies of mating systems as they are thought to exhibit a greater diversity in mating systems than any other mammalian order, and thus make great models for improving our fundamental understanding of causes and consequences of social organisation. Here, we review the current knowledge of bat mating systems. Our analyses show that research on bat mating systems has not kept pace with research on bats in general and that traditional typologies do not accommodate the mating system of several species. Therefore, we propose an alternative, functional framework to categorise mating systems of bats and by extension of other taxa. We argue that mating systems can be classified according to a male reproductive skew continuum, with an increasing skew from monogamy to true lekking. We include an additional category of lek-like mating system along the continuum to account for previous trans-categorical cases that have the appearance of resource defence but are functionally akin to a lek. The new framework has a total of seven categories: promiscuity, monogamy, female defence polygyny, resource defence polygyny, a lek-like mating system, exploded classical lek, and clustered classical lek. Applying this framework to bats reveals that lek mating systems are more prevalent in bats than previously recognised. It is our aim that this review and the proposed framework provide a greater understanding of bat mating systems particularly and provoke research into the factors that shape mating systems across animal taxa more generally.","2024","2024-11-11 21:25:23","2024-11-11 21:25:26","2024-11-11 21:25:23","e70149","","8","14","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Author(s).

Bats—a remarkably rich and diverse group—use habitat from fine (< 0.5 km) to broad (> 4 km) scales, and thus identifying their responses to changing landscapes can highlight a variety of management implications. We conducted a literature review of >170 peer-reviewed studies from five continents of landscape-scale studies in bats. We used cluster analysis to highlight study trends and identify biases and knowledge gaps in landscape-scale studies of bats. Species in the families Vespertilionidae and Phyllostomidae, which represent 51 % of extant bat diversity, were the focus of two thirds of studies; other families were underrepresented. Tropical and subtropical Africa and Asia, notable for their high bat species richness, were underrepresented in studies. Although considered by few studies, context-dependent demographic data, including temporal and behavioral parameters (e.g., age, season) were important for explaining bat-landscape interactions. No one-size-fits-all set of variables or scales exists for bats, and even closely related species vary in their responses to variable-scale combinations. However, variables that quantify habitat size and presence of patch edges were often strong predictors of bat use. Based on this review, researchers should consider a range of scales including broad scales (>5 km), landscape and bioclimatic variables, and archiving data for future studies across temporal scales. We provide a list of recommendations that can help researchers and conservationists improve inferences in determining the landscape associations of bats species and other taxa.","2024-11-01","2024-11-11 21:27:47","2024-11-11 21:27:50","2024-11-11 21:27:47","110829","","","299","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\HF6EDZ9P\Martínez-Fonseca et al. - 2024 - A global review of landscape-scale analyses in bats reveals geographic and taxonomic biases and oppo.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\3QPLNVHI\S0006320724003914.html","","","Chiroptera; Cluster-analysis; Habitat fragmentation; Landscape mosaic; Multi-scale; Spatial scaling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This review verifies the trends in pollution research, in particular, the use of genetic markers in the study of bats, based on a literature search of the Web of Science and Scopus platforms. Sixteen publications were identified during the search, which focused on the timeframe between 1996 and March 2022, including investigations of the effects of heavy metals, agricultural pesticides, and radiation. The studies were based primarily on the application of biomarkers for genotoxic analysis, including the comet assay, micronucleus test, and the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Only 55 bat species have been investigated up to now, that is, 4% of the 1447 currently recognized. In general, bats exposed to polluted environments presented a higher frequency of genotoxic and mutagenic damage than those sampled in clean environments. Given the importance of the diverse ecological functions provided by bats, including pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal, it is increasingly necessary to investigate the damage caused to the health of these animals exposed to areas with high concentrations of contaminants.

Here, we review and qualitatively describe trends in the occurrence and apparent causes of multiple mortality events (MMEs) in bats around the world. We compiled a database of MMEs, defined as cases in which ≥ 10 dead bats were counted or estimated at a specific location within a maximum timescale of a year, and more typically within a few days or a season. We tabulated 1180 MMEs within nine categories. Prior to 2000, intentional killing by humans caused the greatest proportion of MMEs in bats. In North America and Europe, people typically killed bats because they were perceived as nuisances. Intentional killing occurred in South America for vampire bat control, in Asia and Australia for fruit depredation control, and in Africa and Asia for human food. Biotic factors, accidents, and natural abiotic factors were also important historically. Chemical contaminants were confirmed causes of MMEs in North America, Europe, and in islands. Viral and bacterial diseases ranked low as causes of MMEs in bats. Two factors led to a major shift in causes of MMEs in bats at around 2000: the global increase of industrial wind-power facilities and the outbreak of white-nose syndrome in North America. Collisions with wind turbines and white-nose syndrome are now the leading causes of reported MMEs in bats. Collectively, over half of all reported MMEs were of anthropogenic origin. The documented occurrence of MMEs in bats due to abiotic factors such as intense storms, flooding, heat waves, and drought is likely to increase in the future with climate change. Coupled with the chronic threats of roosting and foraging habitat loss, increasing mortality through MMEs is unlikely to be compensated for, given the need for high survival in the dynamics of bat populations.","2016","2024-01-09 23:27:34","2024-11-20 20:23:52","2024-11-12 20:16:12","175-190","","3","46","","","Multiple mortality events in bats","","","","","","","en","© 2016 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12064","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\6NYWWGM2\O'Shea et al. - 2016 - Multiple mortality events in bats a global review.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Z39HUIB5\O'Shea et al. - 2016 - Multiple mortality events in bats a global review.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\ZEK9GSJB\mam.html","","","conservation; bats; mortality; disease; wind turbines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High levels of offtake were reported throughout Asia, the Pacific islands and some Western Indian Ocean islands, where fruit bats of the genus Pteropus are eaten extensively. Most hunting in Africa was reported in western states and the largest fruit bat Eidolon helvum was preferred. Insectivorous bats are also eaten, particularly Tadarida in Asia. Hunting is both for local consumption and commercial, sometimes involving cross-border transactions. The high levels of hunting reported and the low reproductive rate of bats indicate there are likely to be severe negative effects on bat populations, and declines of several species are documented. Although there has been only one reported attempt to manage offtake, this indicates that it is possible and apparently successful. Furthermore, voluntary controls on hunting have halted declines in bat numbers. There have been several initiatives to reduce hunting pressure and conserve threatened bat species, mainly on islands that, when sustained, have been successful. More education projects and community-based conservation initiatives should be encouraged together with further attempts at sustainable harvesting in situations where disease risk has been evaluated.","2009-04","2024-01-09 23:24:57","2024-11-12 21:38:36","2024-11-12 20:23:10","217-234","","2","43","","","Bats as bushmeat","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RDC8SXRF\Mickleburgh et al. - 2009 - Bats as bushmeat a global review.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\22S9AXRL\Mickleburgh et al. - 2009 - Bats as bushmeat a global review.pdf","","","Bats; bushmeat; commercial hunting; Eidolon; Pteropus; sustainability; Tadarida","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Echo classification is essential for bats’ everyday life; for instance, it enables bats to use acoustical landmarks for navigation and to recognize food sources from other objects. Most of the research of echo based object classification in echo-locating bats was done in the context of simple artificial objects. These objects might represent prey, flower, or fruit and are characterized by simple echoes with a single up to several reflectors. Bats, however, must also be able to use echoes that return from complex structures such as plants or other types of background. Such echoes are characterized by superpositions of many reflections that can only be described using a stochastic statistical approach. Scientists have only lately started to address the issue of complex echo classification by echo-locating bats. Some behavioral evidence showing that bats can classify complex echoes has been accumulated and several hypotheses have been suggested as to how they do so.

Here, using a bibliographic approach to indicate research strengths and priorities, we summarised scientific information on Philippine bats from 2000 to 2017. We examine relationships between thematic areas and effort allocated for each species, diet group, and conservation status. We found that an average of 7.9 studies was published annually with the majority focused on diversity and community surveys. However, research effort is not even between taxonomic groups, thematic areas or species, with disproportionate effort focusing on “tax-onomy and systematics” and “ecology”. Species effort allocation between threatened and less threatened species does not show a significant difference, though this may be because generalist species are found in many studies, whereas rarer species have single species studies devoted to them. A growing collaborative effort in bat conservation initiatives in the Philippines has focused on the protection of many endemic and threatened species (e.g., flying foxes) and their habitats. The implementation of conservation relevant policies, outreach programs, capacity building, and mainstreaming of evidence-based conservation are encouraged to strengthen bat conservation in the Philippines.","2018-07-01","2024-11-12 20:33:32","2025-01-08 21:29:42","2024-11-12 20:33:32","46-56","","1","91","","Mamm Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Conservation; Islands; National red list; Priorities; Research efforts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among mammals, short-lived species such as shrews have a maximum lifespan of about a year, whereas long-lived species such as whales can live for more than two centuries. Because of their slow pace of life, long-lived species are typically of high conservation concern and of special scientific interest. This applies not only to large mammals such as whales, but also to small-sized bats and mole-rats. To understand the typically complex social behavior of long-lived mammals and protect their threatened populations, field studies that cover substantial parts of a species’ maximum lifespan are required. However, long-term field studies on mammals are an exception because the collection of individualized data requires considerable resources over long time periods in species where individuals can live for decades. Field studies that span decades do not fit well in the current career and funding regime in science. This is unfortunate, as the existing long-term studies on mammals yielded exciting insights into animal behavior and contributed data important for protecting their populations. Here, I present results of long-term field studies on the behavior, demography, and life history of bats, with a particular focus on my long-term studies on wild Bechstein’s bats.

Yet relatively few mechanistic studies have focused on this longevity. On average, species of Chiroptera live three times longer than predicted by their body size. In addition, bats have other life history traits that are characteristic of large, long-lived mammals such as few and large offspring and slow growth rates. Bats fit the evolutionary theory of ageing, as their extended longevity is predicted by their ability to escape extrinsic mortality through flight and, in some species, hibernation. They also show tradeoffs between longevity and reproduction, as predicted by the disposable soma theory of ageing. From a physiological perspective, bat longevity reportedly correlates with replicative longevity, low brain calpain activity, and reduced reactive oxygen species production.

Bats are a species-rich, globally distributed group of organisms that are thought to be particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change because of their high surface-to-volume ratios and low reproductive rates. We systematically reviewed the literature on bat responses to climate change to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps and biases and highlight future research needs. We found that studies are geographically biased towards Europe, North America and Australia, and temperate and Mediterranean biomes, thus missing a substantial proportion of bat diversity and thermal responses. Less than half of the published studies provide concrete evidence for bat responses to climate change. For over a third of studied bat species, response evidence is only based on predictive species distribution models. Consequently, the most frequently reported responses involve range shifts (57% of species) and changes in patterns of species diversity (26%). Bats showed a variety of responses, including both positive (e.g. range expansion and population increase) and negative responses (range contraction and population decrease), although responses to extreme events were always negative or neutral. Spatial responses varied in their outcome and across families, with almost all taxonomic groups featuring both range expansions and contractions, while demographic responses were strongly biased towards negative outcomes, particularly among Pteropodidae and Molossidae. The commonly used correlative modelling approaches can be applied to many species, but do not provide mechanistic insight into behavioural, physiological, phenological or genetic responses. There was a paucity of experimental studies (26%), and only a small proportion of the 396 bat species covered in the examined studies were studied using long-term and/or experimental approaches (11%), even though they are more informative about the effects of climate change. We emphasise the need for more empirical studies to unravel the multifaceted nature of bats' responses to climate change and the need for standardised study designs that will enable synthesis and meta-analysis of the literature. Finally, we stress the importance of overcoming geographic and taxonomic disparities through strengthening research capacity in the Global South to provide a more comprehensive view of terrestrial biodiversity responses to climate change.","2023","2024-11-11 22:18:15","2024-11-25 21:26:38","2024-11-12 21:23:04","19-33","","1","98","","","Bat responses to climate change","","","","","","","en","© 2022 The Authors.

Predator–prey relationships are, however, poorly understood in taxa not typically associated with these interactions; this is especially the case when bats (Chiroptera) are the prey. The main aim here is to review and synthesise global information on the predation of bats by birds of prey (Accipitriformes and Falconiformes) and other diurnal bird groups. We compiled data on incidences of predation of bats by diurnal birds, through an extensive multilingual study of bibliographic and Internet-based sources. Scientific papers were found mainly via the Thomson Reuters (Web of Science and Zoological Record) and Scopus databases, Google Scholar, and Google Books. Additional data were found through Internet searches of trip reports, images and videos carried by Google, Google Images, Flickr, and YouTube. In total, more than 1500 cases of bats being attacked by diurnal predatory birds were obtained. Reports were documented from every continent (except Antarctica) and from 109 countries, and were thus distributed globally between 70°N and 43°S. Overall, we found evidence for predation of bats by 143 species of diurnal raptors (Accipitriformes 107 spp. and Falconiformes 36 spp.) and by 94 non-raptor bird species from 28 families. At least 124 and 50 bat species were taken as prey by raptors and by other diurnal bird species, respectively. Attacks on bats by diurnal raptors were found to be distributed globally and were present in the majority of extant raptor lineages. Attacks on bats by other diurnal birds were also occasionally recorded. Furthermore, the majority of extant bat families featured as prey. These results strongly suggest that predation by birds may act as a major factor affecting the scarcity of daytime activity in bats and as a driver in the evolution of bat nocturnality.","2016","2024-11-12 21:24:33","2024-11-12 21:24:33","2024-11-12 21:24:33","160-174","","3","46","","","Bats as prey of diurnal birds","","","","","","","en","© 2016 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12060","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\ETJ2GQSL\Mikula et al. - 2016 - Bats as prey of diurnal birds a global perspective.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\NGFVQFLJ\mam.html","","","bats; avian predation hypothesis; diurnal birds; nocturnality; predation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bats might compete for key resources, and cases of exaggerated divergence of resource-related characters or trait overdispersion in bat assemblages are often explained in terms of current or past interspecific competition. However, other pressures leading to patterns that mimic the outcome of competition cannot always be ruled out. We present the state of knowledge on IC among bats, providing a critical evaluation of the information available and identifying open questions and challenges. We reviewed 100 documents addressing potential or actual IC in bats and categorised them in terms of the resource for which bats compete (food, foraging habitat, roosts, water, and acoustic space). We also examined the ecomorphological and behavioural traits considered therein to highlight responses to IC or niche partitioning. We found that: although resources should be limiting in order for competition to occur, this is seldom tested; sympatry is sometimes taken as synonymous of syntopy (yet sympatric species that are not syntopic will never experience competition); comparisons between sympatry and allopatry are rare; and testing of objective criteria exploring the existence of niche partitioning or character displacement is not commonly adopted. While morphological examination of food remains in droppings has often led to coarse-grained analysis that proved insufficient to establish the occurrence of food niche overlap or partitioning, new frontiers are being opened by state-of-the-art molecular dietary analysis. A better understanding of IC in bats is paramount, since distributional changes leading to novel bat assemblages driven by climate change are already taking place, and the dramatic decline in insect availability, as well as the global loss or alteration of foraging habitat, may generate new competitive interactions or exacerbate existing interactions in the Anthropocene, and into the future.","2020","2024-11-12 21:24:46","2025-01-08 21:31:18","2024-11-12 21:24:46","68-81","","1","50","","","Interspecific competition in bats","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12180","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\J6QMXNCU\Salinas-Ramos et al. - 2020 - Interspecific competition in bats state of knowledge and research challenges.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\V9N5WB8D\mam.html","","","bats; character displacement; climate change; global; interspecific competition; niche partitioning; resource","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used network analyses to determine to what extent interventions for bats overlap those used for other subterranean taxa. We conducted our analyses with data extracted from 345 papers recommending a total of 910 conservation interventions. Gating of roost entrances was applied to preserve bat populations in 21 studies, but its effectiveness was unclear.

Decontamination was assessed in 2 studies and positively affected bat populations, particularly in studies focused on reducing fungal spores associated with white-nose syndrome in North America. Monitoring of bat populations as an effective conservation strategy was unclear and infrequently tested. Only 4% of bat studies simultaneously considered other subterranean organisms.

In addition to the direct risk of collision of bats with vehicles, roads could pose a threat to bat populations as a result of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and could act as barriers to movements of bats between habitats. We performed a systematic review of the literature and conducted meta-analyses to assess the threat posed by roads to bats as a result of 1) collisions between bats and vehicles and 2) roads acting as barriers to movements of bats. Based on collated records of 1207 bat road casualties in Europe, we found that low-flying species are more prone to collisions than high-flying species, and that juveniles are more vulnerable to collisions than adults. In addition, meta-analysis identified a significant bias towards male casualties. Casualties included rare species such as Barbastella barbastellus and geographically restricted species such as Rhinolophus species. The bias towards male casualties could be indicative of greater natal philopatry or lower dispersal among females, or of sexual segregation in habitats of varying quality, i.e. females may occupy better quality habitats than males, and road density may be lower in better quality habitats. Whether or not roads act as barriers to the movement of bats depends on a complex interplay of habitat and species-specific behaviour. For example, the presence of favourable habitat for bats – notably woodland – was found in this review to be linked with significantly reduced barrier effects but a heightened risk of collision. Our data suggest that roads do pose a threat to bats. Future research should assess the contribution of traffic noise and street lighting to the barrier effect of roads. Where new road schemes are monitored by ecological practitioners, it is vital that consistent protocols are employed to ensure that bat activity can be compared before and after the road is built. Evidence from such research should be used to minimize the risks for bats of any roads built in the future, and to design safe crossing points for bats.","2016","2024-11-12 21:28:23","2024-11-12 21:28:27","2024-11-12 21:28:23","311-323","","4","46","","","Roads and bats","","","","","","","en","© 2016 The Authors.

This evolutionary relationship impressed the global media, which then emphasised bats as key actors in the spillover that resulted in the pandemic. In this study, we highlight changes in the traditional and new media coverage of bats and in Internet search volumes that occurred since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We analysed Google and Wikipedia searches for bats and coronaviruses in 21 countries and eight languages, as well as television broadcasts in the USA, some of which have global coverage, between January 2016 and December 2020. In January 2020, the amount of television news about bats boomed, and news associated with the term ‘bat’ shifted to COVID-19-related topics. A nearly identical pattern was observed in Google searches during 2020 at the global scale. The daily time series of television coverage and Internet search volumes on bats and coronavirus in the USA covaried in the first quarter of 2020, in line with the existence of a media bubble. Time-series analysis revealed that both the Google Trends index and visits to Wikipedia pages about bats boomed in early 2020, despite the fact that this time of year is usually characterised by low search volumes. Media coverage emphasised, correctly or not, the role of bats in the COVID-19 pandemic and amplified public interest in bats worldwide. The public image of these mammals, in many cases threatened and important ecosystem service providers, was seriously compromised. We therefore recommend that policymakers and journalists prioritise scientifically accurate communication campaigns about bats, which would help counteract the surge in bat persecution, and leverage interest towards positive human–bat interactions.","2022","2024-11-12 21:30:01","2024-11-12 21:30:01","2024-11-12 21:30:01","16-25","","1","52","","","COVID-19, media coverage of bats and related Web searches","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12261","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\XAVVMAGI\Cerri et al. - 2022 - COVID-19, media coverage of bats and related Web searches a turning point for bat conservation.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\F4NA9BJQ\mam.html","","","conservation; conservación; COVID-19; bats Chiroptera; COVID-­19; Google; murciélagos Chiroptera; noticias televisivas; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-­CoV-­2; television news; Wikipedia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there has been little previous consideration of the extent and impact of predation of bats by cats, or of whether specific characteristics make certain species of bats particularly vulnerable to predation by cats. We reviewed the impact of cats on bats, based on a collation of scientific literature and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List database. Our aim was to produce a synthesis of the extent to which cats prey upon and threaten bats. We also collated available data on cat diet, which provide information on predation rates of bats by cats. Few studies (n = 44) have identified bat species preyed upon or threatened by cats, with a disproportionate number of studies from islands. In these studies, 86 bat species (about 7% of the global extant tally) are reported as preyed upon or threatened by cats, and about one quarter of these species are listed as Near Threatened or threatened (IUCN categories Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable). In IUCN Red List assessments, cats are more frequently mentioned as a threat to threatened or Near Threatened bat species than to non-threatened species (IUCN category Least Concern). In studies reporting on the incidence of bats in cat dietary samples (scats, stomachs and guts), the frequency of occurrence of bats in samples averaged 0.7 ± 2.1% (mean ± standard deviation; n = 102). Many studies had sample sizes that were too small to be likely to detect bats. All forms of cat are reported to kill bats, and such predation has been reported in all major terrestrial habitats.

We review the diets, hunting behaviour and roosting ecology of 17 bat species that are known to consume terrestrial vertebrates: Vampyrum spectrum, Chrotopterus auritus, Trachops cirrhosus, Macroderma gigas, Megaderma (Lyroderma) lyra, Nycteris grandis, Nyctalus lasiopterus, Nyctalus aviator, Ia io, Antrozous pallidus, Cardioderma cor, Phyllostomus hastatus, Mimon (Gardnerycteris) crenulatum, Mimon cozumelae, Tonatia saurophila, Tonatia bidens, and Lophostoma silvicolum. Data on their diet and roosts were obtained from 241 original works, with considerable differences in the amount of research and information available among species. Carnivorous bats were found to belong to an ecologically diverse group and share little but their diet. Therefore, we define a carnivorous bat as a bat that, either year-round or seasonally, uses terrestrial vertebrates as the main component of its diet, at least in part of its geographic range. We conclude from available data that Mimon crenulatum, Lophostoma silvicolum, Mimon cozumelae, Phyllostomus hastatus, Tonatia bidens, Tonatia saurophila, Cardioderma cor, and Antrozous pallidus use vertebrates as a minor part of their diet and should not be considered carnivorous. The nine other species we reviewed do fit into the definition of carnivorous bats, and can be further subdivided based on their ecology and the seasonality of their habits into three categories: year-round predominantly gleaning carnivores (Chrotopterus auritus, Trachops cirrhosus, and Vampyrum spectrum), seasonal predominantly gleaning carnivores (Megaderma lyra, Macroderma gigas, and Nycteris grandis) and seasonal aerial-hawking bird-eating carnivores (Ia io, Nyctalus aviator, and Nyctalus lasiopterus).","2021","2024-11-12 21:30:30","2024-11-12 21:30:30","2024-11-12 21:30:30","540-558","","4","51","","","We eat meat","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12254","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\VNWX9SUH\Gual-Suárez y Medellín - 2021 - We eat meat a review of carnivory in bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\ACF8I848\mam.html","","","diet; dieta; Chiroptera; predation; carnivorous bats; comportamiento de cacería; depredación; ecología de forrajeo; ecología de refugios; foraging ecology; hunting behaviour; murciélagos carnívoros; roosting ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite limited research resources, research efforts frequently fail to target conservation priorities. Island endemic bats (IEBs) are a poorly studied group inhabiting some of the world's most vulnerable habitats, and for which no review of research allocation has ever been conducted. We conducted a bibliometric review to evaluate the global research patterns for IEBs with respect to individual species, geographical distribution and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List categories. Additionally, we studied the relationship between the number of publications and changes in Red List category, and identified species-based and area-based priorities for future research. IEBs are significantly more threatened than bat species that are not island endemics. However, research focusing on IEBs is scarce, centred on species of lesser conservation concern, and spatially asymmetric, overlooking areas of high IEB biodiversity. Conservation-oriented research seems to target species facing high extinction risk, but is extremely thinly and unevenly distributed. Although we found a positive association between research effort and improvement in Red List category, an increase in extinction risk did not trigger more scientific attention. A prioritisation analysis highlighted, as the top five islands for species richness in the least-studied and highest conservation concern IEBs: Sulawesi, Timor, New Guinea, Java, and Borneo. The ten species of highest research priority include threatened and Data Deficient species from Southeast Asian and Pacific islands. Conservation-oriented research seems to be too scarce to satisfy conservation needs. The observed mismatch between research allocation and conservation priorities may reflect the fact that highly endangered species are unattractive targets for fund-raising, due to species crypticity, high research budget requirements, and high risk of project failure. However, our findings support the importance of research for the conservation of IEBs, and we therefore advocate that more attention is directed towards the least-known species.","2017","2024-11-12 21:30:41","2024-11-20 20:23:36","2024-11-12 21:30:41","169-182","","3","47","","","Insular bats and research effort","","","","","","","en","© 2017 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12090","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\IZJMFLN9\Conenna et al. - 2017 - Insular bats and research effort a review of global patterns and priorities.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\VXRFYKLT\mam.html","","","conservation; island bats; prioritisation; Red List Index; research allocation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Neotropical phyllostomid bats Carollia, Sturnira and Artibeus, this feeding habit has evolved to become specialized in the core plant taxa Piper, Solanum, and Ficus and Cecropia, respectively. I review the intrinsic factors that promote differences in diet among frugivorous bats of the genera Carollia, Sturnira and Artibeus and the interaction between these and extrinsic factors that affect bat community structure. The intrinsic factors are internal variables associated with fruit selection, body mass and nutrient digestibility that constrain the animals to exploit fruits with different morphological and nutritional characteristics. Intrinsic factors that explain frugivorous bat diet can thus drive community structure in frugivorous bats. The extrinsic factors that affect frugivorous bat community structure are associated with chiropterochoric plant phenology and composition, as well as with human activities that impact food availability. Nutritional diversity in chiropterochoric plants and the digestive capacity of frugivorous bats are key factors in understanding diet partitioning in Neotropical frugivorous bats. These factors are related to food availability and nutrition in bats and could be the major determinants of community structure of frugivorous bats in conserved and disturbed habitats.","2014","2024-11-12 21:30:48","2024-11-12 21:30:48","2024-11-12 21:30:48","215-224","","3-4","44","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12024","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\WTKGAVTZ\Saldaña-Vázquez - 2014 - Intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting dietary specialization in Neotropical frugivorous bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Y6DK8GCW\mam.html","","","Phyllostomidae; Chiroptera; frugivory; Neotropics; bat–plant interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluate the trophic structure of frugivorous phyllostomids using multiple data sets collected throughout the Neotropics. Then, we investigate the relationship between trophic and phylogenetic structure of phyllostomids, and evaluate the evolutionary mechanisms driving current resource partitioning in phyllostomid assemblages. We compiled a data set of 14500 dietary records from 24 well-studied bat communities in the Neotropics. We recoded data at the plant genus level and composed two new data sets including tropical sites only, and tropical and subtropical sites pooled (i.e. including sites where diversity is significantly reduced). We performed multivariate analyses on both data sets and estimated phylogenetic effects on the dietary patterns. Dietary structure in both data sets indicated that bat species remained faithful to their core plant taxa. A phylogenetic comparative method selected only a few basal clades from the entire phyllostomid tree that significantly explained the impact of evolutionary history on the observed multivariate patterns. These clades were dated to the middle Miocene, a period of particularly intense geological and environmental changes in the Neotropics. These clades were always younger than the core plant taxa with which they were strongly associated. Accordingly, the core diet of phyllostomid bats has remained remarkably stable since at least the past 15 My (million years), suggesting a bottom-up control of the evolution of the bat-plant interactions in the Neotropics.","2018","2024-11-12 21:30:55","2024-11-12 21:30:55","2024-11-12 21:30:55","90-107","","2","48","","","Trophic structure of frugivorous bats in the Neotropics","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12116","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\WWPNJ3CQ\Sánchez y Giannini - 2018 - Trophic structure of frugivorous bats in the Neotropics emergent patterns in evolutionary history.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\QA7TDDQQ\mam.html","","","evolution; Phyllostomidae; bat-plant interactions; bottom-up control; dietary specialisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Males of many mammal species tend to be larger or more ornamented than females, and these characteristics tend to be more pronounced in polygynous, diurnal, and open-habitat species. Bats have long been considered a largely non-sexually dimorphic group due to lack of conspicuous differences in body size and other cranial and skeletal characters. However, bats, like many mammals, exhibit a diverse array of soft-tissue integumentary glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures with intense odorous substances that have not been thoroughly investigated, although postulated functions include facilitating mate selection in their generally polygynous associations. To date, there has been no systematic assessment of the occurrence or expression of sexually dimorphic traits in bats, many of which show intriguing sexual dimorphism in soft tissue, and most of which involve intense odours. In this study, we review evidence of integumentary glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures known in bats, as a first step towards identifying future research pathways to study sexual dimorphism in bats. Highly variable glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures have been noticed in ten different regions of the body, but are most frequently found on the head and the ventral region of the neck. They have been described in nearly 9% of bat species and in 70% of 21 extant bat families. Our review, based on extremely scattered and unevenly detailed literature, unveils the extraordinary sexual dimorphism that has been observed in Chiroptera to date, identifying not only target body parts where sexually dimorphic traits are likely to be found, but also critical avenues for future investigation and discoveries, and stressing the importance of the timing of secondary sexual trait observations, behavioural studies, and chemical analyses.","2021","2024-11-12 21:31:04","2024-11-25 22:02:32","2024-11-12 21:31:04","155-177","","2","51","","","Redefining the study of sexual dimorphism in bats","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12232","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Y8CL9K3C\Muñoz-Romo et al. - 2021 - Redefining the study of sexual dimorphism in bats following the odour trail.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\BV8TRJAD\mam.html","","To Read","Chiroptera; bat courtship signals; chemical communication; comunicación química; dimorfismo sexual; glands; glándulas; odours; olores; selección sexual; señales de cortejo de murciélagos; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is bats’ main sense for orientation and recognising biotopes that provide food, water, and roosts. It is widely accepted that echolocation call frequency is related to body mass, and this relationship has been described as the ‘allometric hypothesis’, which proposes a negative correlation between these variables. There is evidence that, in many cases, the allometric hypothesis does not apply. Additionally, studies supporting this hypothesis were done at the family level, resulting in a broad range of correlation values with r ranging from −0.36 to −0.76, and only insectivorous bats were included. Due to the notable exceptions and the lack of a quantitative synthesis of this hypothesis including all echolocating bats, we evaluated the allometric hypothesis of echolocation calls for this group. Using a meta-analysis and phylogenetic generalised least-squares techniques, we evaluated the relationship between echolocation call peak frequency and the body mass of bats. We found a negative relationship between body mass and echolocation call peak frequency for the 85 bat species that were included in our analysis (r = −0.3, p = 0.005). The relationship was consistent when we analysed the data at the insectivorous guild level, and in bats belonging to the families Vespertilionidae, Rhinolophidae, Emballonuridae, and the genus Myotis. However, the wide range of r values suggests that the strength of the relationship between peak frequency and body mass varies within the order Chiroptera. Our results support the allometric hypothesis of sound production in echolocating bats. However, the low coefficient we found suggests that factors other than body mass may influence the peak frequency of echolocation calls produced by bats.","2020","2024-11-12 21:33:58","2024-11-12 21:34:02","2024-11-12 21:33:58","304-313","","3","50","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12196","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RHPQ4WZA\López-Cuamatzi et al. - 2020 - Does body mass restrict call peak frequency in echolocating bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\VY35YRPQ\mam.html","","","global; Chiroptera; morphology; allometry; comparative biology; foraging behaviour; niche differentiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this issue, we reviewed 53 studies on the effects of land-use changes on bats in the country from 1990 to 2018. Bats were chosen because they contribute towards numerous ecosystem services, including seed dispersal and insect control. For each study, we obtained data on the biome where fieldwork was conducted, participating institutes, sampling method, sampling effort, main results and academic impact. Spatial scales of studies were divided into ‘local’, ‘fragment’, ‘landscape’ or ‘metapopulation’. Our results indicate an increasing interest in bats and land-use changes in Brazil over time; however, no trend in academic impact factor was found. Studies carried out in the Atlantic Forest were the most common, appearing earlier in the literature, but studies in Amazonia, often from long-term research, had larger sampling efforts, were published in higher impact factor journals and received more citations. We identified several gaps in the literature: 1) lack of acoustic surveys complementing mist-netting, 2) telemetry studies were rare, 3) underrepresentation of the Caatinga biome, along with Pantanal and Grasslands (= Pampa), and 4) fewer studies using the landscape and fragment scale than local studies. We suggest that future research should focus on filling those gaps. Bat diversity is often found to be positively related to forest cover, fragment size and natural vegetation. Logging and agroforestry seem to have the lesser impact on bats compared to agriculture and urbanisation. Only haematophagous bats are benefited by pastures. We found guild-specific responses to land-use changes. Haematophagous batsseem to be the least impacted by them compared to other guilds, while animalivorous bats are particularly impacted by habitat fragmentation. Facing continuous deforestation, we can expect that bat diversity in Brazil will possibly reduce. Conservation efforts should focus on species shown to be sensitive to land-use changes, especially where higher deforestation rates are expected.","2021","2024-11-12 21:34:40","2024-11-12 21:34:44","2024-11-12 21:34:40","127-142","","1","51","","","Effects of land-use changes on Brazilian bats","","","","","","","en","© 2020 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12227","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\IUUMS7L3\Mendes y Srbek-Araujo - 2021 - Effects of land-use changes on Brazilian bats a review of current knowledge.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\R3UP8TIE\mam.html","","","Mammalia; Chiroptera; Neotropics; deforestation; fragmentation; habitat loss; landscape ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is widespread misunderstanding and misuse of the associated terminology and concepts in the scientific literature. We conducted an extensive assessment and standardisation of published and unpublished cases of chromatic disorders in bats worldwide. Chromatic disorders have been recorded in at least 609 bats belonging to 115 species and 10 families (after correction of misused terms, 152 cases of albinism, 11 of leucism, 269 of piebaldism, 20 of hypomelanism, three of partial melanism and 94 of melanism; a further 60 records remain unclassified). Of the 354 records in which a location was given, 297 bats were found in closed roost sites, mainly caves, buildings, and mines and galleries, while just three were found roosting externally. This difference could be attributed to the greater monitoring effort employed in underground areas than in forests, and to the greater detectability of bats dwelling in caves and buildings than forest-dwelling species. Although reports of chromatic disorders in bats are reasonably well spread around the globe, there are large areas from which no disorders have ever been reported: the Central Amazon, almost all of Africa, northern Europe, and almost all of Asia and Oceania. This is likely to be attributable to either the disregard for information on chromatic disorders (e.g. Central Amazon) or to the low abundance of occurring species (e.g. northern Europe). In all, 40% of the records of leucism and piebaldism were misclassified as ‘partial albinism’; leucism was also often used to designate pied aberrations. We propose a standardised classification to distinguish between albinism, leucism, piebaldism, hypomelanism, melanism and partial melanism. Due to frequent confusion, we encourage scientists to follow this classification and we highlight the need to employ comprehensive terminology when describing chromatic disorders in scientific publications.","2017","2024-11-12 21:34:54","2024-11-12 21:34:54","2024-11-12 21:34:54","112-123","","2","47","","","Chromatic disorders in bats","","","","","","","en","© 2016 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12083","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\UWUE32XD\Lucati y López-Baucells - 2017 - Chromatic disorders in bats a review of pigmentation anomalies and the misuse of terms to describe.pdf","","","Chiroptera; albinism; chromatic disorders; partial albinism; piebaldism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We reviewed the literature for negative effects of invasive species to bats and summarised threats according to four categories: predation, disease, competition, and indirect interactions. We identified threats of 37 invasive species to 40 bat species. Ten bat species were threatened by more than one invasion pathway. About 38 percent of cases are speculative and 18 percent circumstantial, many attributed to overlapping ranges, and most accounts do not quantify effects needed to forecast bat population impacts. Evidence of cat predation is frequently cited, constituting the greatest incidence of observational data. Other direct and indirect impacts were documented from goats, dogs, brown tree snake, rainbow lorikeet, rose-ringed parakeet, yellow crazy ant, giant centipede, palm, burdock, avian cholera, and white-nose syndrome. Circumstantial evidence suggests impacts by rats, stoats, coqui frog, common wolf snake, little fire ant, kudzu, and Lantana camara. Other impacts by giant centipede, yellow crazy ant, cats, goats, rats, and avian cholera are speculative, as are those from pigs, deer, white eye, common starling, house sparrow, rock dove, barn and little owls, brush-tailed possum, honeybee, wasp, phytophagous insects, tamarisk, Cinnamomum verum, and Tabebuia pallida. Over 60 percent of bat species reviewed are island-dwelling, corresponding with evidence indicating that most extinctions occur on islands and invasive species’ impacts are worse for island than mainland populations. Although appreciable bat population reductions owing to invasive species are often unproven, invasions are likely to exacerbate effects of other vulnerabilities. Multiple invaders and synergistic interactions may ultimately lead to species losses. Managers should exercise the precautionary principle by taking action against non-native species when first detected, even if new species do not appear to be detrimental.","2017","2024-11-12 21:35:11","2024-11-12 21:35:11","2024-11-12 21:35:11","277-290","","4","47","","","The threat of invasive species to bats","","","","","","","en","© 2017 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12099","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\KJSR8TW8\Welch y Leppanen - 2017 - The threat of invasive species to bats a review.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\2CWXIA5V\mam.html","","","conservation; invasive species; Chiroptera; biodiversity loss; biological invasions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives of the present review were to evaluate the importance of aquatic resources for bats and to identify the effects that eutrophication, water pollution, and other anthropogenic impacts on water bodies have on bats. Most studies on bats and aquatic habitats have been conducted in Europe or in North America. They show, directly or indirectly, how bats use aquatic resources. Acoustic survey is the most common technique employed to assess habitat use by bats, although some researchers have used radio telemetry or other methods. Myotis daubentonii is the most commonly studied species. Within this topic, research does not tend to be focused more on threatened species. The effects of water pollution and eutrophication on bats remain unclear: different effects are reported for different species and in different areas.

Although they can be very different species with locally distinct needs, radical exploitation of forest habitats and global changes have meant that many of them are regionally endangered and survive today only in small populations. To help develop appropriate conservation policies and management plans, much research in recent decades has been focussed on inferring habitat selection by tree-dwelling bats. However, large variability in the reported selection patterns makes it difficult to suggest some more-or-less universal and easily applicable management recommendations, also for regions in which nature conservation awareness is low. We created a meta-analytic model to explore selection patterns at a global scale. Phylogenetic relationships among species and additional variables were included to explain discrepancies between studies. A meta-analytic model showed that bats are selecting trees with trunk diameters that are larger than those of randomly selected trees, and this pattern is consistent within each biogeographical region. However, meta-regression revealed that the detectability of the selection depends strongly on the structural variability within the study environment (size of randomly selected or surrounding trees in forest stands, forest fragmentation, habitat disturbance) and on the methodological approach that has been applied (the length of the study). We found stronger selection for larger trees in non-fragmented and less disturbed forests than in fragmented forests with high habitat disturbance, and, strikingly, short-term studies yielded results with stronger selection than long-term studies. Our results suggest that patterns of roosting habitat selection by bats may be overestimated in some studies. In conclusion, we propose that further research should be conducted in all types of forest ecosystem (data from the tropics are currently missing). Future studies should include at least three years of data collection, in order to avoid estimation bias in habitat selection patterns.","2015","2024-11-12 21:36:05","2024-11-12 21:36:05","2024-11-12 21:36:04","215-226","","4","45","","","Roost site selection by tree-dwelling bats across biogeographical regions","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12044","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Y9EX7MLR\Naďo y Kaňuch - 2015 - Roost site selection by tree-dwelling bats across biogeographical regions an updated meta-analysis.pdf","","","Chiroptera; habitat use; nature protection; temperate zones; woodland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These areas are home to 55% of mammal species. Bats have the second highest species richness among mammals, and, although many species are adapted to arid conditions, they are particularly sensitive in these habitats and require conservation priority. Information on bats in arid and semi-arid landscapes is scattered, patchy and focused on small-scale studies; therefore, we undertook a systematic review using the PRISMA protocol to identify the current knowledge status, detect knowledge gaps and propose future research priorities. We analysed 346 published articles and evaluated 40 topics within five topic categories (taxa studied, methodologies used, biology, ecology and conservation). The most commonly studied topic categories were ecology and biology. However, we found a gap in the topic category conservation (including topics such as conservation status and roost conservation). Our network analysis of topics within the categories showed that most ecology papers were focused on distribution, species richness and habitat use. When we analysed keywords, we found that phylogeny, taxonomy and distribution demonstrated relatively high presence. Moreover, comparison of the percentage of studies conducted in dry-lands and the percentage of land surface area covered by dry-lands in the continents revealed that dry-lands in Africa and Australia were especially under-represented. Our review shows that knowledge of bats in semi-arid and arid landscapes is biased towards new records of the distribution of species, as well as covering systematic/taxonomic and morphological aspects of bat biology. We suggest that research on conservation measures and guidelines to protect the bat species found in semi-arid and arid landscapes should be prioritised, together with the sharing of knowledge with local practitioners and the development of citizen science programmes.","2020","2024-11-12 21:40:06","2024-11-12 21:40:06","2024-11-12 21:40:06","52-67","","1","50","","","Bat ecology and conservation in semi-arid and arid landscapes","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12175","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\PHA427SX\Lisón et al. - 2020 - Bat ecology and conservation in semi-arid and arid landscapes a global systematic review.pdf","","","conservation; biodiversity; global; Chiroptera; habitat loss; desertification; dry-land","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conservation of Japanese bats is of global concern, given that 35% of extant species are endemic and 91% of endemics are threatened. However, information on Japanese bats can be inaccessible to the international community, and research trends have yet to be reviewed. To investigate how thoroughly research has addressed conservation needs concerning Japanese bats, we related IUCN category, legal protections, and threats to the results of a systematic review of conservation-relevant research literature from the last fifty years. We assessed patterns in research distribution in time, regions, research topics, taxa, endemicity, and category to identify gaps and future priorities. We also compared research patterns between international research repositories and the main Japanese repository. Categories did not change over time (except due to changes in knowledge; actual conservation status remained the same), and bat-specific legal protections and conservation actions are limited (e.g. only one species benefits from a national recovery plan). Research has increased post-2000, but threatened and endemic species remain less studied than non-threatened and non-endemic species. Both the shortage of ecological studies (≤ 1 article) and lack of any conservation study for over 50% of extant species (including most threatened species) are concerning. Ten endemics were identified as top priority species: Murina tenebrosa, Myotis yanbarensis, Murina ryukyuana, Nyctalus furvus, Miniopterus fuscus, Pteropus pselaphon, Myotis pruinosus, Eptesicus japonensis, Rhinolophus perditus, and Hipposideros turpis. Japanese bat conservation could be strengthened by increasing research on endemic species and by providing information on threats, ecological requirements, population trends, and suitable conservation strategies. Concrete conservation planning, improved publishing standards, capacity-building, and a collaborative effort to improve the situation of bats domestically would set a strong example for bat conservation in Asia.","2021","2024-11-12 21:40:34","2024-11-12 21:40:34","2024-11-12 21:40:34","109-126","","1","51","","","In the shadow of the rising sun","","","","","","","en","© 2020 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12226","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\YUYILUU4\Preble et al. - 2021 - In the shadow of the rising sun a systematic review of Japanese bat research and conservation.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\KFJJXBDM\mam.html","","","research priorities; bats (Chiroptera); threatened species; bibliometrics; Japan; language barrier; research-implementation gap; コウモリ; 日本; 研究－実務間ギャップ; 研究の優先順位づけ; 絶滅危惧種; 言葉の壁; 計量書誌学","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They fill an important ecological niche and have diversified into a wide range of habitats. In recent years, bats have been implicated as reservoirs for some of the most highly pathogenic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases reported to date, including SARS-like coronavirus, Ebola, Hendra and Nipah viruses. The ability of bats to harbour these viruses in the absence of clinical signs of disease has resulted in a resurgence of interest in bat biology and virus–host interactions. Interest in bats, in Australia in particular, has intensified following the identification of several novel bat-borne viruses from flying-foxes, including Hendra virus, which is capable of spillover from bats to horses and subsequently to humans with potentially fatal consequences. As we continue to encroach on the natural habitats of bats, a better understanding of bat biology, ecology and virus–host interactions has never before been so critical. In this review, we focus on the biology of Australian pteropid bats and the pathogens they harbour, summarising current knowledge of bat-borne diseases, bat ecology, ethology and immunology.","2013-05-03","2024-11-12 21:41:51","2024-11-12 21:41:55","2024-11-12 21:41:51","48-57","","1","61","","Aust.

This is especially true in long-lived, group-living species that encounter moderate levels of environmental heterogeneity. Here we review the social learning literature that uses bats as models under the framework of Galef (2009) and Laland (2009) to examine when, where, and from whom bats are most likely to learn socially about food and other foraging behaviour. We conclude that evidence exists for bats learning about novel foods from other bats, learning how to handle such food from other bats, and that bats often learn these ways when uncertain about the quality of different foods available. There is also evidence that young bats learn about new foods from their mothers, and that adult bats learn from other adult bats, even other bat species. However, whether bats more likely to learn from familiar individuals or learn about specific foraging areas from others is less established and warrants further research. We also conclude that phyllostomid bats present the best evidence of social learning about food and suggest future research, including investigating the possibility of nonhuman culture, focus on this diverse group.","2023-05","2024-11-12 21:42:35","2024-11-12 21:42:39","2024-11-12 21:42:35","294-306","","5","101","","Can.

These declines can be partially mitigated through actions that boost reproductive success; therefore, management aimed at promoting availability of high-quality roosting habitat is an important conservation goal. Following the principles of the umbrella species concept, if co-occurring species share similar roost-tree preferences, then management practices targeting one species may confer conservation benefits to another. We conducted a systematic review of roost-site characteristics of thirteen species inhabiting eastern temperate forests to: (1) synthesize existing knowledge across species; (2) assess niche overlap among co-occurring species; and (3) evaluate the potential for currently protected species to serve as conservation umbrellas. We performed multivariate ordination techniques to group species based on the seven most-reported roost-site characteristics, including tree species, diameter at breast height, tree health, roost type, tree height, canopy closure, and roost height. Species sorted into three roosting guilds: (1) southern wetland inhabitants; (2) foliage specialists; and (3) dead tree generalists.

Yet, the demand for research-funding is large and tracing the current knowledge is a key step to define priority research topics. In this same span, studies on bats in China have uncovered an overlooked diversity and revealed novelties in bats’ evolutionary history and life-history aspects. All this 21st-century knowledge, however, is scattered and a large part is concealed from most of the international scientific community in Mandarin-language articles. Here, we summarize the post-millennium (2000–2017) research on bats in China and point out trends and future directions based on neglected topics, groups, and regions. In addition, we provide an up-to-date list of bat species in China. We retrieved 594 publications related to bats in China, nearly half were written in Mandarin. At least 147 bat species are present in China, which places it among the most bat-rich countries in the world. There was a significant positive trend on the number of publications, from 12.5 annual average in 2000–2005 to 46.5 in recent years, reflecting the Chinese economic-scientific development in this century. We found marked taxonomic and spatial biases. Half of the studies in this century focused on Rhinolophus, Myotis, and Hipposideros, and the southern and eastern provinces were the most studied. Systematic/taxonomy and Ecology were the predominant topics post-millennium, whereas only 10 articles have clear conservation-driven goals. Our review shows that the majority of studies were focused on the least concern, cave-dweller species, and on bat-rich provinces. Future projects should address the effects of human-modified landscapes on bat community to define proper conservation actions.

Based on 130 studies, published from 1999 to 2020, we obtained echolocation parameters from 64 bat species (47.4% of the total echolocating species known from the country). This review highlights the lack of echolocation references from continental China for 71 species, from which, the echolocation of 21 has never been described. Additionally, we developed the Bat Knowledge Index, an indicator that allows the identification of key priority areas for future research on bat acoustics and geographic biases in the existing studies, further highlighting the lack of studies in the northwestern regions of the country. The compiled identification key provides easy-to-follow identification steps to classify the echolocation calls of 114 species (84.5% of all Chinese echolocating species) to either species (11.4%) or phonic group level (88.6%).

Here, we summarize ways in which unrelated bats cooperate while roosting, foraging, feeding or caring for offspring. For each situation, we ask if cooperation involves an investment, and if so, what mechanisms might ensure a return. While some cooperative outcomes are likely a by-product of selfish behaviour as they are in many other vertebrates, we explain how cooperative investments can occur in several situations and are particularly evident in food sharing among common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and alloparental care by greater spear-nosed bats (Phyllostomus hastatus). Fieldwork and experiments on vampire bats indicate that sharing blood with non-kin expands the number of possible donors beyond kin and promotes reciprocal help by strengthening long-term social bonds. Similarly, more than 25 years of recapture data and field observations of greater spear-nosed bats reveal multiple cooperative investments occurring within stable groups of non-kin. These studies illustrate how bats can serve as models for understanding how cooperation is regulated in social vertebrates.","2016-02-05","2024-11-12 22:12:07","2024-11-12 22:12:09","2024-11-12 22:12:07","20150095","","1687","371","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\L46PMNXL\Wilkinson et al. - 2016 - Non-kin cooperation in bats.pdf","","","by-product mutualism; group augmentation; partner choice; reciprocity; spear-nosed bats; vampire bats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review the literature related to conflicts between livestock production and the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus, specifically, the factors that influence the incidence of problems caused by bites to cattle. We summarise the strategies proposed to reduce these problems and propose actions from the perspectives of cattle management, landscape ecology and the biology of the common vampire bat. The literature shows that free-range extensive management systems, where cattle graze in areas with forest cover, near riparian zones, caves, secondary vegetation (generally shrublands and immature trees), and vegetation fragments and edges, increase the implications and the severity of the conflict. As a result of different selection forces, the wing morphology and echolocation characteristics of the common vampire bat facilitate its movement under these landscape conditions, thus favouring a scenario of greater interaction with cattle. We propose the establishment of a ‘buffer zone’ to separate the cattle as far as possible (at least 1 km) from the elements of the landscape that are key for the movement patterns of common vampire bats in cattle ranching areas. The feeding events of this species are positively associated with host availability and landscape elements that provide habitat and connectivity, which shows that the cause of this conflict originates from the process of cattle production and the invasion of the habitat of the common vampire bat. Anti-rabies vaccination programmes in cattle and forest–cattle separation are the most important strategies to minimise conflict and prevent rabies outbreaks.","2023","2024-11-12 22:13:06","2024-11-12 22:13:06","2024-11-12 22:13:06","72-83","","2","53","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12313","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\JFUQY3Z5\Mendoza-Sáenz et al. - 2023 - Reducing conflict between the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus and cattle ranching in Neotropica.pdf","","","systematic review; revisión sistemática; Neotropics; zoonosis; cattle management; common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus; conflicto humanos-vida silvestre; estrategias de prevención y mitigación; human-wildlife conflict; Manejo de ganado; murciélago vampiro común Desmodus rotundus; neotrópico; prevention and mitigation strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review published studies globally from both complementary approaches. We further present an economic model for the avoided cost of bat predation on stinkbugs, the major economic pest of macadamias in South Africa, currently the world’s largest macadamia producer. We calculated both the direct (reduced stinkbug damage due to bat predation) and indirect (reduced pesticide use) avoided costs. We estimated the density of bats in a macadamia-growing region of South Africa to be 7.5–22.5 bats/ha, based on opportunistic data from the Merlin DeTEct (Inc.) avian-avoidance radar system. Current economic parameters for macadamia production, stinkbug injury coefficients and life history were obtained from the literature and from the Southern African Macadamia Association (SAMAC).We estimated the level of bat predation on pest stinkbugs in macadamia orchards from published dietary studies combined with both high and low published values for insect consumption rates relative to bat body mass. We found that the protected yield due to bat predation of stink bugs amounted to 0.53% (low consumption rates) to 1.29% (high consumption rates) of annual macadamia production in South Africa for 2015. Based on current macadamia prices, the approximate avoided cost values of these combined direct and indirect bat predation services varied between 9% and 23% of the current annual estimated cost of damage caused by stinkbugs to South African macadamia orchards (US$613/ha). Losing bats to disease epidemics, wind farms, human persecution or excessive or highly toxic pesticide applications could therefore significantly increase annual losses to the macadamia industry in South Africa caused by stinkbugs.","2018-04-01","2024-11-12 22:13:21","2024-11-12 22:13:21","2024-11-12 22:13:21","372-381","","","30","","Ecosystem Services","","Linking ecosystem services to livelihoods in southern Africa","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Bats; Macadamia nuts; Pentatomidae; Predation ecosystem services; Stink bugs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, reliability of current data on which to base management of forest-roosting bats is uncertain. Therefore, we surveyed peer-reviewed manuscripts pertaining to habitat ecology of forest-roosting bats for the period 1980-2001. We found that there were limited data upon which to base habitat management for forest-roosting bats because relatively few studies (56 over 21 years) have been conducted, most have occurred primarily in older-aged forests with little to no active forest management, and current research has primarily focused on roost-site selection to infer habitat relationships and response to habitat change. Limited sample sizes and pseudoreplication were prevalent, and management recommendations often were made without regard to inferential bounds of collected data. We contend that studies using bat detectors have limited ability to infer habitat selection per se, and recommend that studies incorporating detectors define more appropriate objectives regarding habitat associations. The best use of bat detectors may be generation of hypotheses of habitat selection to be tested with more appropriate techniques. There also is a need to conduct more long-term, holistic, experimentally designed research, to focus habitat research on 1-2 focal species per study, and to expand habitat research to include a wider diversity of forest types and management regimes. We suggest that cooperative research efforts be developed to secure sufficient funding and logistical support for such studies. We also recommend that authors clearly state the objectives of their study, including sampling assumptions and limitations; define inferential space; ensure that results are interpreted within inferential bounds of their data, especially at the proper spatial scale; and use consistent terminology when articulating concepts and results of their work.","2003-03","2024-11-12 22:24:34","2024-11-12 22:24:34","2024-11-12 22:24:34","30-44","","1","31","","","Habitat management for forest-roosting bats of North America","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Kentucky","","","","","","","Chiroptera; Bats; North America; Bat detectors; Forest-roosting bats; Forests; Habitat management; Habitat selection; Habitat studies; Pseudoreplication; Radiotelemetry; Roosts; Study design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in life-history traits do not occur independently, as they trade off or co-evolve with other traits. Hibernation is a life-history trait used to cope with periods of low resource availability. The energetic and survival benefits of hibernation depend on environmental conditions. Climate change-induced changes in hibernation patterns are therefore likely to affect other life-history traits through trade-offs. We systematically reviewed the literature to: 1) identify studies testing for associations between climatic variables and life-history traits in mammalian hibernators; and 2) assess variation in responses between species. Air temperature was the most commonly measured climatic variable, and phenology of hibernation emergence was the most commonly studied life-history trait. In most studies and species, emergence date became earlier, litter size increased and the number of interbout arousals increased with increasing air temperature. Despite being considered key life-history traits due to their potential to influence population dynamics, our search returned no studies on the effects of climatic variables on the age of primiparity or on the age distribution of reproduction. Directions of associations between climatic variables and life-history traits often differed between species, and both species- and sex-specific variations occurred in response to climatic variables for some traits. We highlight the importance of long-term, species-specific research, and the need for further studies on indirect effects of climatic cues on co-adapted traits to understand the potential for mammalian hibernators to respond to ongoing and future climate change.","2023","2024-11-12 22:25:33","2024-11-12 22:25:33","2024-11-12 22:25:32","84-98","","2","53","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 The Authors.

The objective of this work was to review and analyse scientific studies on different aspects of bat reproduction published in the last two decades (2000–2019), in order to provide perspective for future research. Using 19 key words, we searched for literature on the reproduction of bats published as book chapters and articles in scientific research journals globally. We analysed 36 chapters in 14 books and 276 scientific articles, from 41 countries, identifying publishing trends throughout the years, preferred journals, countries in which studies have been carried out, and most-studied species and topics. The number of studies increased over the last decade, resulting from the consolidation of research lines in countries such as Brazil, India, Mexico, and USA. The studies covered 125 species, of which Scotophilus heathi and Cynopterus sphinx were the most recurrent, each appearing in 23 studies (7.4%, n = 312). The most common subject was anatomy (61 studies, 20%, n = 312), and the rarest was assisted reproduction techniques (11 studies, 3.5%, n = 312). In the last decade, there has been a trend to increase the study of male anatomy. The application of new techniques for the study of reproduction contributed to more complex studies that favour the understanding of the reproductive process. There is an evident lack of reproductive studies for most species, and there is an information gap regarding research in prenatal development and assisted reproduction techniques. These two topics are greatly significant for future research, because of their direct usefulness for species conservation.","2021","2024-11-12 22:25:48","2024-11-14 22:23:52","2024-11-12 22:25:48","338-352","","3","51","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12236","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\HUHJ8P26\Ocampo-González et al. - 2021 - A review of the breeding biology of Chiroptera.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\PWJ8SG9N\mam.html","","","bats (Chiroptera); reproduction; anatomía reproductiva; ciclos reproductivos; comportamiento reproductivo; endocrinología; endocrinology; gamete morphophysiology; morfofisiología de los gametos; murciélagos (Chiroptera); reproducción; reproductive anatomy; reproductive behaviour; reproductive cycles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparative studies of the evolutionary origins of migration in birds are widespread, but are lacking in mammals. Mammalian species have greater variation in functional traits that may be relevant for migration. Interspecific variation in migration behaviour is often attributed to mode of locomotion (i.e. running, swimming, and flying) and body size, but traits associated with the evolutionary precursor hypothesis, including geographic distribution, habitat, and diet, could also be important predictors of migration in mammals. Furthermore, mammals vary in thermoregulatory strategies and include many heterothermic species, providing an alternative strategy to avoid seasonal resource depletion. We tested the evolutionary precursor hypothesis for the evolution of migration in mammals and tested predictions linking migration to locomotion, body size, geographic distribution, habitat, diet, and thermoregulation. We compiled a dataset of 722 species from 27 mammalian orders and conducted a series of analyses using phylogenetically informed models. Swimming and flying mammals were more likely to migrate than running mammals, and larger species were more likely to migrate than smaller ones. However, heterothermy was common among small running mammals that were unlikely to migrate. High-latitude swimming and flying mammals were more likely to migrate than high-latitude running mammals (where heterothermy was common), and most migratory running mammals were herbivorous. Running mammals and frugivorous bats with high thermoregulatory scope (greater capacity for heterothermy) were less likely to migrate, while insectivorous bats with high thermoregulatory scope were more likely to migrate. Our results indicate a broad range of factors that influence migration, depending on locomotion, body size, and thermoregulation. Our analysis of migration in mammals provided insight into some of the general rules of migration, and we highlight opportunities for future investigations of exceptions to these rules, ultimately leading to a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of migration.","2022","2024-11-12 22:26:02","2025-01-08 21:28:57","2024-11-12 22:26:02","82-95","","1","52","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12263","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\L6LMR7NS\Webber y McGuire - 2022 - Heterothermy, body size, and locomotion as ecological predictors of migration in mammals.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\R7VYGCCI\mam.html","","","body size; evolutionary precursor hypothesis; heterothermy; hibernation; mammals; movement ecology; thermoregulatory scope.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bats act as hosts to a range of viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic zoonoses. Human activities increase the likelihood of exposure to bats, thereby increasing the opportunity for infections to spill over. Continuing ecological processes, emergence and spillover of novel pathogens in naïve hosts, including humans, along with other complex natural phenomena require proper understanding that may help in predicting the next spillover.

More important from a conservation perspective, artificial roosts provide habitat where natural roosts have been lost. Although artificial roosts have been widely used, much of the information on species that use artificial roosts, roost design, and placement is anecdotal and poorly reported. We reviewed the existing literature on artificial roosts to summarize current research and inform research and management decisions. From 47 publications and reports, we identified 48 types of structures used by 59 species. Roosts were constructed from wood (66.7%), concrete (8.3%), or other materials (25.0%) and varied in size and shape from small-volume wood boxes (0.002 m3) to large (6 m tall) free-standing structures. Variables most often considered in the context of attracting bats were aspect, substrate, and mount location; few studies measured height or microclimate. Colonization rates ranged from 7% to 100%. Bats commonly used structures as solitary (21 species) or social (breeding or maternity; 21 species) roosts. Most species documented to use artificial roosts are vespertilionids (73%), have the International Union for Conservation of Nature's designation of least concern (93%), and roost in tree cavities or buildings. Three species are designated as endangered (Myotis sodalis) or near threatened (M. bechsteinii, M. dasycneme). Artificial roosts should be constructed and installed to mimic natural roosts, emphasize requirements of target species, and exclude non-target species.

During these arousals, some bats may undertake activities away from the hibernation site. Systematic ecological studies of the frequency and purpose of winter activity in temperate zone bats of North America are rare and much of the literature involves observations of single individuals or unmarked populations. 2 We review the available literature on winter activity among North American vespertilionid bats to highlight the paucity of data on this subject and to stimulate future research. Due to the lack of repeated, systematic studies on most North American species, the conclusions drawn are general or pertain only to parts of the geographical range of any species. 3 We suggest that winter activity is ubiquitous among temperate zone bats, but the degree and purpose of activity varies greatly between and within species. In general, cave-dwelling bats tend to be relatively inactive compared with tree and foliage roosting bats during winter. 4 Cave-dwelling and tree cavity-dwelling species do not appear to feed, but they do drink and occasionally copulate during the hibernation period. Species that hibernate in foliage or leaf litter are the most active species during winter and may feed and drink throughout winter, although they probably do not copulate because of their solitary nature. 5 We encourage researchers to conduct studies on all aspects of winter activity for North American vespertilionids across wide latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. We suggest studies in the near future be focused on estimating the energetic costs and benefits of winter activity through determination of the frequency and intensity of winter feeding activity and more thorough examinations of movements within and among caves. Studies on common, wide-ranging species have the potential to illuminate large-scale patterns and differences and should be favoured over studies on rarer species.","2006","2024-11-12 22:41:13","2024-11-12 22:41:13","2024-11-12 22:41:13","267-280","","4","36","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2907.2006.00095.x","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\LK2IHF7W\Boyles et al. - 2006 - Activity following arousal in winter in North American vespertilionid bats.pdf","","","Chiroptera; hibernation; feeding; cave bats; hibernacula; tree bats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of synanthropic roosts (SRs) has been explained as a consequence of the decreased availability of natural roosts imposed by habitat destruction, although growing evidence suggests that the use of SRs may be beneficial to bats in many ways, including enabling the expansion of distributional ranges. Based on data from Europe and North America, our study aimed to (1) analyse the proportion of use of synanthropic vs. natural roosts, (2) test the hypothesis that bats are forced to use SRs in response to the destruction of natural habitats, (3) analyse latitudinal variation of the proportion of use of SRs and (4) address the highly contrasting pattern in the proportion of use of SRs between the two continents in the light of historical aspects of coexistence between bats and humans. We compiled published data on day roosts obtained by means of radio-telemetry, providing unbiased evidence of the proportion of synanthropic and natural roosts. We compared the obtained patterns between the two continents, analysed the relationship between the proportion of use of SRs, land cover and latitude and analysed historical reconstruction of anthropogenic land use. In Europe (n = 3385 roosts), SRs were used by twice more (26) bat species and were used 17× more frequently than in North America (n = 6795). We found no support for the hypothesis that bats use SRs in response to habitat destruction. The use of SRs increases with latitude in Europe, but not in North America, despite decreasing areas of human-altered habitats. Historical processes related to the length of coexistence between bats and humans on both continents, rather than the current state of nature, may underlie the contrasting patterns observed.","2024","2024-11-12 21:33:12","2025-01-08 21:46:11","2024-11-12 22:47:21","","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Author(s).

Previous studies have found a large phylogenetic effect and the inclusion of early Eocene fossil bats contributed to recover idiosyncratic body size change patterns in bats. Here, we test these previous hypotheses of bat body size evolution using a large, comprehensive supermatrix phylogeny (+800 taxa) to optimize body size and examine changes reconstructed along branches. Our analysis provides evidence of rapid stem phyletic nanism, an ancestral value stabilized at 12 g for crown-clade Chiroptera followed by backbone stasis, low-magnitude changes inside established families, and massive body size increase at accelerated rate in pteropodid subclades. Total variation amount explained by pteropodid subclades was 86.3%, with most changes reconstructed as phyletic increases but also apomorphic decreases. We evaluate these macroevolutionary patterns in light of the constraints hypothesis, and in terms of both neutral and adaptive evolutionary models. The reconstructed macroevolution of bat body size led us to propose that echolocation and flight work as successive, nested constraints limiting bat evolution along the body size scale.","2020-03-01","2024-11-14 19:32:50","2024-11-14 20:39:14","2024-11-14 19:32:50","123-138","","1","27","","J Mammal Evol","Evolution of Body Mass in Bats","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\KAHCNMTC\Moyers Arévalo et al. - 2020 - Evolution of Body Mass in Bats Insights from a Large Supermatrix Phylogeny.pdf","","","Chiroptera; Macroevolution; Body mass reconstruction; Nested constraints; Optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its generality has been supported by some studies but contested by others. Bats are cosmopolitan and speciose mammals thus are ideal to test ecogeographic patterns. Based on three functionally distinct measures of body size, I compare mainland and island variation in bats at the order to subspecies level. Location Globally. Taxon Chiroptera. Methods I compiled information from literature on the skull length, forearm length, and body mass of 251 bat species in 840 locations. For conspecific bats from different locations, I calculated size divergences, and categorized them as within-mainland (M–M), mainland-to-island (M–I), or island-to-island (I–I). I used a modified size ratio to quantify divergences, analysis of variance, non-parametric tests, and effect sizes to complement statistical significances. Results On islands, cranial size increases, wing length becomes more uniform, and body mass decreases more often than not. The first trend would support the island rule, but had a small effect size. Families differ considerably in how they vary geographically. Species are ranked very differently based on functionally distinct size measures. Divergences are uniform across M–M, M–I, and I–I ranges, and large between bats of different subspecies. Main Conclusions Likely owing to limitations imposed by flight and echolocation, bats do not follow the island rule. The absence of correlation between how bats are ranked based on them indicates that functionally distinct size measures are not necessarily coadaptive. High vagilities may lead to low local differentiation, but interfamilial variation shows this differentiation to also depend on other factors.

To describe the morphology of the forelimbs, we used six biomechanical indices, and evaluated their correlation with foraging habitats and trophic guilds in five families of bats distributed in the Neotropical region. We examined 140 specimens belonging to 23 genera and 43 extant species. Among the morpho-functional indices analyzed, the epicondylar index, the humeral robustness, and the radial distal end width index were the variables that most contributed to the discriminant functions. Our results showed a direct correlation between forelimb morphology and foraging habitats, which could indicate that these morphological characteristics are possibly shared, despite the different evolutionary histories in the analyzed taxa.

By using data on geographical and elevational distribution ranges from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), we examined bat species richness on mountains, species that predominantly occur in mountains (‘mountain dwelling species’), and those restricted to upper montane and alpine regions within mountains (‘highland dwelling species’). We also used published trait datasets to investigate the traits that are associated with mountain dwelling in bats. Globally, we identified 148 mountain dwelling and 46 highland dwelling bat species. Bat diversity is highest in the Northern Andes and Guiana Highlands. The mountain dwelling nature of bat species was found to be significantly associated with biogeographic realm. Importantly, our results show that mountain dwelling species are proportionately more data deficient than species that predominantly occur in lowlands. Additionally, highland dwelling species are proportionately more threatened than lowland species. Our results highlight a significant dearth of knowledge on mountain dwelling bat species.

In line with our expectations, excluding the predominantly clutter foraging bat families from our dataset downplayed the importance of the richness-mediated route.

The timing and evidence for evolution of their novel adaptations have been difficult to ascertain from the fossil record due to chronological gaps and the fragmentary nature of most fossil bat material. Here, we quantify the quality of the bat fossil record using skeletal and character completeness metrics, which respectively document for each taxon what proportion of a complete skeleton is preserved, and the proportion of phylogenetic characters that can be scored. Completeness scores were collected for 441 valid fossil bat species in 167 genera from the Eocene to the Pleistocene. All metrics record similar temporal patterns: peak completeness in the Lutetian stage reflects the presence of Lagerstätten, while subsequent stages have very low completeness, except an Aquitanian high and a Pleistocene peak in skeletal completeness. Bat completeness is not correlated with intensity of sampling through geological time but has a weak negative correlation with publication date. There is no correlation between taxonomic richness and completeness, as the bat record predominately consists of diagnostic but isolated teeth. Consequently, bat skeletal completeness is the lowest of any previously assessed tetrapod group, but character completeness is similar to parareptiles and birds. Bats have significantly higher character completeness in the northern hemisphere, probably due to heightened historical interest and presence of Lagerstätten. Taxa derived from caves are more complete than those from fluviolacustrine and marine deposits, but do not preserve highly complete specimens.","2019","2024-11-14 20:11:31","2024-11-14 20:11:31","2024-11-14 20:11:31","757-776","","5","62","","","","","","","","","","en","© The Palaeontological Association","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pala.12426","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\LBQUS8YJ\Brown et al. - 2019 - Quantifying the completeness of the bat fossil record.pdf","","","Chiroptera; caves; Cenozoic; completeness metrics; Lagerstätten; sampling bias","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We adopted a two-dimensional geometric morphometric approach to quantify the wing shape and size variation explained by phylogenetic relatedness (families) and to evaluate the covariance between foraging guilds and flight descriptors based on phylogenetic comparative methods in 69 Neotropical bat species. We tested whether wing morphology represents a reliable marker of the foraging guild, and we explored the rate of shape evolution among foraging guilds to describe divergent trends that could explain the morphological and ecological diversification. Our results suggest that the earliest bat ancestor was an aerial forager occupying the edge space, which is congruent with the observed evolution of wing shape from an edge space wing morphology.

Studies addressing the identification of patterns and variations across several guilds are fundamental in ecomorphological research. Wings are the core of ecological morphology in bats; nevertheless, individual bones and structures that support the wing, including metacarpals, phalanges and the length of digits, have rarely been the subject of comprehensive research when studying wing morphology. Here, I analyzed morphological variations of wing structures across 11 bat guilds and how individual bone structures are correlated to diet, foraging mode and habitat use. I obtained wing measurements from 1512 voucher specimens of 97 species. All the specimens analyzed came from the Mammalian Collection at the Museo Javeriano de Historia Natural of Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (MPUJ-MAMM) (Bogotá, Colombia). Positive correlations between size and the length of the third and fifth digit were detected. Bat guilds that capture their preys using aerial strategy in uncluttered habitats had longer third digits but short fifth digits compared to guilds that rely on gleaning strategy and forage in highly cluttered space. Although terminal phalanges were shown to be important structures for guild classification, metacarpals were strongly related to aerial foragers from uncluttered habitats because of their potential role in flight performance and ecological adaptations. Results show that habitat use, as well as foraging mode, are reflected in wing structures. Different wing traits to those evaluated in this study should be considered to better understand the ecological interactions, foraging strategy, wing adaptations, and flight performance in Neotropical bats.","2020-01-01","2024-01-09 23:26:20","2024-11-20 20:20:37","","","","59","無","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (CSL JSON)","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\7Q7EYM2C\Dennis Castillo-Figueroa - 2020 - Ecological Morphology of Neotropical Bat Wing Stru.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this, the importance of wetlands for bat conservation and the consequences of losing these habitats are not comprehensively understood. Through a systematic literature review, we quantified the knowledge gaps regarding bats in wetlands by: 1) assessing research trends over time; 2) evaluating research biases in geography, themes, species, seasons, and methodology; 3) creating the ‘bat Knowledge Index’ (bKI), a standard indicator for measuring how well-studied bats in wetlands are per country; 4) compiling and summarising the ecological responses of bats to wetlands; and 5) assessing how bat researchers perceive the role of wetlands for bat conservation. We found strong similarities between the reviewed studies and the bat researchers’ perceptions. However, although 75% of respondents considered wetlands important for bat conservation, they rarely studied these habitats. Most of the studies took place in developed countries, leaving critical gaps in countries where wetlands are rapidly decreasing. The bKI can be used as a tool for land managers to prioritise conservation actions and resources for the protection of bats in wetlands geographically. Research topics were found to be biased towards habitat selection and species inventory, with many topics only superficially explored. There was also an important seasonal bias, resulting in many unanswered questions during energetically demanding periods for bats (e.g. migration). However, constantly evolving technological developments, such as bat lures and tracking devices, might aid new studies in these habitats. Up to 66% of studies reported that wetlands benefit bat activity or species richness, mainly because of high prey densities and the availability of fresh water. However, the low number of studies and all the identified research gaps make ‘bats and wetlands’ a largely underexplored ecological interaction between a poorly studied animal taxon and an increasingly threatened habitat.","2021","2024-11-11 20:32:09","2024-11-20 19:35:22","2024-11-14 20:21:33","369-384","","3","51","","","Bats and wetlands","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12243","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\R4T44V3I\Mas et al. - 2021 - Bats and wetlands synthesising gaps in current knowledge and future opportunities for conservation.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RIC99VXG\mam.html","","","conservation; conservación; Chiroptera; hibernation; hibernación; humedales; lagoons; marsh; migración; migration; murciélagos; sistemas acuáticos; water ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location The New World. Time period Present day. Major taxa studied Bats. Methods I assembled 152 local species inventories from the published literature, which include 245 species, along with body mass measurements and dietary categorizations. I quantified species richness using the Chao 1 extrapolator, obtained mean mass values for the inventories and computed proportions of species and of individuals belonging to different feeding guilds. I reduced the dimensonality of environmental variables using factor analysis and regressed richness values upon the factor scores. Results South of the Tropic of Cancer, bats exhibit sharp increases in local diversity, the abundance of frugivores and nectarivores, and mean body mass. These offsets are driven by increases in the richness and abundance of the leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae). Richness steeply declines near the Tropic of Capricorn, but the other variables do not trend strongly at this point. Most of the variance is explained by mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality and precipitation. There is no direct evidence that richness is lower in disturbed landscapes. Main conclusions The great radiation of phyllostomids in the Neotropics has created a uniquely rich biota. The reason that phyllostomids are now absent from the northern temperate zone might be that they are mostly frugivores or nectarivores. Therefore, they have prospered only in regions that provide fruit and nectar year-round. Thus, biotic interactions might be the immediate cause of the latitudinal diversity gradient in New World bats. If so, then the biogeographical break is driven by environmental factors and is not a historical artefact. These results suggest that a more nuanced consideration of latitudinal gradients will prove to be helpful when it comes to studying many taxonomic groups.","2019","2024-01-29 22:26:51","2024-11-20 20:23:38","2024-11-14 20:27:52","784-792","","6","28","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.12892","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\JEEENYXI\Alroy - 2019 - Latitudinal gradients in the ecology of New World .pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\WWLWPFYX\Alroy - 2019 - Latitudinal gradients in the ecology of New World bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\XGDZ2KKA\geb.html","","","species richness; body mass; Chao 1; feeding guilds; latitudinal diversity gradients; New World bats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The potential consequences of these biases could be more detrimental in the less-studied megadiverse regions, often characterized by high biodiversity and serious risks of human threats, as conservation and management actions could be misdirected. Here, focusing on 134 bat species in Mexico, we analyze spatial and taxonomic biases and their drivers in occurrence data; and identify priority areas for further data collection which are currently under-sampled or at future environmental risk. We collated a comprehensive database of 26,192 presence-only bat records in Mexico to characterize taxonomic and spatial biases and relate them to species' characteristics (range size and foraging behavior). Next, we examined variables related to accessibility, species richness and security to explain the spatial patterns in occurrence records. Finally, we compared the spatial distributions of existing data and future threats to these species to highlight those regions that are likely to experience an increased level of threats but are currently under-surveyed. We found taxonomic biases, where species with wider geographical ranges and narrow-space foragers (species easily captured with traditional methods), had more occurrence data. There was a significant oversampling toward tropical regions, and the presence and number of records was positively associated with areas of high topographic heterogeneity, road density, urban, and protected areas, and negatively associated with areas which were predicted to have future increases in temperature and precipitation. Sampling efforts for Mexican bats appear to have focused disproportionately on easily captured species, tropical regions, areas of high species richness and security; leading to under-sampling in areas of high future threats. These biases could substantially influence the assessment of current status of, and future anthropogenic impacts on, this diverse species group in a tropical megadiverse country.","2019","2024-11-14 20:54:33","2024-11-14 20:54:33","2024-11-14 20:54:32","14130-14141","","24","9","","","Spatial and taxonomic biases in bat records","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

Highlighting the urgent need for protection, an especially large fraction of cave endemic species may be undescribed. Yet these more challenging systems are also vulnerable, with karsts for example losing a considerable proportion of their area each year. Bats are keystone to cave ecosystems making them potential surrogates to understand cave diversity patterns and identify conservation priorities. On a global scale, almost half (48 %) of known bat species use caves for parts of their life histories, with 32 % endemic to a single country, and 15 % currently threatened. We combined global analysis of cave bats from the IUCN spatial data with site-specific analysis of 1930 bat caves from 46 countries to develop global priorities for the conservation of the most vulnerable subterranean ecosystems. Globally, 28 % of caves showed high bat diversity and were highly threatened. The highest regional concentration of conservation priority caves was in the Palearctic and tropical regions (except the Afrotropical, which requires more intensive cave data sampling). Our results further highlight the importance of prioritising bat caves by incorporating locally collected data and optimising parameter selection (i.e., appropriate landscape features and threats). Finally, to protect and conserve these ecosystems it is crucial that we use frameworks such as this to identify priorities in species and habitat-level and map vulnerable underground habitats with the highest biodiversity and distinctiveness.","2022-10-15","2024-01-29 23:43:41","2024-11-20 20:23:44","2024-11-14 20:54:57","156909","","","843","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\EWCD7PXI\Tanalgo et al. - 2022 - Mapping global conservation priorities and habitat vulnerabilities for cave-dwelling bats in a chang.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Q8II3R4N\S0048969722040062.html; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\QY7H54WT\Tanalgo et al. - 2022 - Mapping global conservation priorities and habitat.pdf","","","Bioindicators; Evolutionary distinctiveness; Extinction risks; Island endemism; Subterranean habitats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in lighting technology have led to a diverse range of emerging low energy light types and a trend towards the increased use of white light. Light pollution affects ecological interactions across a range of taxa and has adverse effects on behaviours such as foraging, reproduction and communication. Almost a quarter of bat species globally are threatened and the key underlying threat to populations is pressure on resources from increasing human populations. Being nocturnal, bats are among the taxa most likely to be affected by light pollution. In this paper we provide an overview of the current trends in artificial lighting followed by a review of the current evidence of the impacts of lighting on bat behaviour, particularly foraging, commuting, emergence, roosting and hibernation.

In many countries, particularly parts of Europe, this figure is substantially higher and most agricultural land is under intensive practices aimed at maximising the production of food. The intensification and expansion of modern agricultural practices led to the biological simplification of the farmed environment, which has resulted in declines in farmland biodiversity during the last century. As with other taxa, many bat species have suffered severe population declines during the 20th century, with agriculture believed to be one of the main drivers reducing roost availability and foraging habitat. Lower intensity farming methods, and the creation or management of habitat features on farmland could potentially mitigate some of these negative impacts but the effects of this on bats, in comparison to other taxa, have received relatively little attention. Here, I review evidence on the impacts of efforts to increase biodiversity in agricultural landscapes on bat populations, and explore whether responses of bats to agricultural activities are similar to those of other taxa, a necessary requirement if they are to be used as bioindicator species. There are relatively few studies with which to assess the effects of management interventions on bats in agricultural landscapes, and these are restricted to only a few countries. Nevertheless, there is evidence that bats benefit from lower intensity agricultural systems, specifically organic farming and shaded agroforestry: these systems tend to be associated with higher bat abundance, species richness and diversity, and are more heavily utilised by foraging bats. Whilst very few studies have explicitly tested the utility of bats as bioindicators in agricultural landscapes, overall, the response of bats to lower intensity agricultural systems also reflects responses by other taxa. These studies have been largely restricted to temperate regions, however. The review highlights several major gaps in our knowledge of bats in agricultural landscapes and where future research could be usefully directed including: (1) a broader geographical range of studies examining both the efficacy, and the underlying mechanisms through which lower intensity agricultural systems may benefit bats; (2) the potential for lower intensity systems in key crops such as oil-palm; (3) studies of the demographic effects of conservation management on bats; (4) in order to assess the potential of bats as bioindicators, studies quantifying the response of both bats and other taxa to environmental change in a wider range of biomes and regions are needed.","2015-05-01","2024-11-14 21:16:20","2024-11-14 21:16:20","2024-11-14 21:16:20","191-204","","3","80","","Mammalian Biology","Mitigating the impacts of agriculture on biodiversity","Special Issue: Bats as Bioindicators","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Chiroptera; Conservation; Agriculture; Bioindicator species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We collected bat distribution data from 1408 studies and assigned them to Japan's First Standard Grid (approximately 6400 km2). Japanese bat assemblages were analyzed at two scales: the entire Japanese Archipelago comprised 16 islands and exclusively the four main islands. At first, we calculated taxonomic and functional total beta diversity (βtotal) by Jaccard pairwise dissimilarity and then divided this into turnover (βrepl) and richness-difference (βrich) components. We conducted hierarchical clustering of taxonomic beta diversity to examine the influence of the two representative sea straits, Tsugaru and Tokara, which are considered biogeographical borders. Variation partitioning was conducted to evaluate the relative effects of the three factors on the beta diversity. Clustering revealed that the Tokara Strait bordered the two major clades; however, the Tsugaru Strait did not act as a biogeographical border for bats. In the variation partitioning, shared fraction between spatial and historical factors significantly explained taxonomic and functional βtotal and taxonomic βrepl at the entire archipelago scale, but not at the four main islands scale extending only Tsugaru Strait but not Tokara Strait. Pure environmental factors significantly explained functional βtotal at both scales and taxonomic βtotal only at the four main islands scale. These results suggest that spatial and historical factors are more pronounced in biogeographical borders, primarily structuring assemblage composition at the entire archipelago scale, especially in taxonomic dimension. However, current environmental factors primarily shape the assemblage composition of Japanese bats at the main island scale. The difference in results between the two scales highlights that the primary processes governing assemblages of both dimensions depend on the quality of the dispersal barriers between terrestrial and aquatic barriers for bats.","2024","2024-11-14 21:24:38","2024-11-14 21:25:04","2024-11-14 21:24:38","e11277","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Authors.

This review assesses the state of knowledge of the ecosystem services provided by bats as pest consumers at a global level and provides recommendations that may favour the efficiency of pest predation by bats. Through a systematic review, we assess evidence for predation, the top-down effect of bats on crops and the economic value of ecosystem services these mammals provide, describing the different methodological approaches used in a total of 66 reviewed articles and 18 agroecosystem types. We also provide a list of detailed conservation measures and management recommendations found in the scientific literature that may favour the delivery of this important ecosystem service, including actions aimed at restoring bat populations in agroecosystems. The most frequent recommendations include increasing habitat heterogeneity, providing additional roosts, and implementing laws to protect bats and reduce agrochemical use. However, very little evidence is available on the direct consequences of these practices on bat insectivory in farmland. Additionally, through a second in-depth systematic review of scientific articles focused on bat diet and, as part of the ongoing European Cost Action project CA18107, we provide a complete list of 2308 documented interactions between bat species and their respective insect pest prey.

Extant bats demonstrate varying levels of terrestrial competency, however, the terrestrial abilities of many groups are unknown. Here we examine the terrestrial ability and resultant traces produced by bats belonging to the families Phyllostomidae and Emballonuridae. Five different subfamilies of phyllostomids and the emballonurid Saccopteryx bilineata were video recorded and analyzed for their terrestrial locomotor behaviors over a sand medium, with resultant tracks and trackways cast and measured. Behaviors and traces were compared to morphological criteria previously hypothesized to constrain terrestrial abilities of bats. Type 1 species (presumed poor walkers) generally performed only a breaststrokelike crawl and nonambulatory searching behavior, whereas the terrestrially adept Type 3 Desmodus rotundus performed a diagonal sequence walk and bound. Behaviors and traces produced by the intermediate Type 2 S. bilineata were indistinguishable from those of the Type 1 bats. Results only partially support the hypothesized morphological basis for terrestrial ability in bats and indicate that ecological differences or as yet unrecognized morphological variations may be the cause of behavioral variations in bats of the same morphotype. This research fills gaps in our knowledge of the terrestrial behaviors of nondesmodontine phyllostomid bats, and is the first study to examine the terrestrial behaviors of any species of emballonurid.

Such migrations have important implications for the basic and applied ecology of animals making these movements. The idea that bats make altitudinal migrations has been suggested for nearly a century. However, studies documenting the existence and causes of altitudinal bat migrations are scarce, and are frequently published in the ‘grey’ literature. For the first time, we comprehensively review the evidence supporting the existence of altitudinal bat migrations worldwide, describe basic patterns of migration in temperate and tropical regions, and articulate and propose tests of hypotheses potentially explaining these migrations. We compiled a list of 50 studies indicative of altitudinal bat migration in 61 species (five families) from 21 countries (four continents). The temporal and spatial patterns of these migrations grouped biogeographically. Temperate bats generally exhibit sex-biased migrations with females inhabiting lower elevations than males during reproductive periods. Although there is less information on tropical bat migration, few studies report sex-biased migration. We compiled hypotheses proposed in the bat and (more extensive) avian literature to provide a list of hypotheses potentially explaining altitudinal bat migrations. These hypotheses rely upon temporal availability of (and competition for) food resources, spatial distribution of geomorphological features suitable for hibernation, sex-related differences in the use of torpor, mating opportunities, and climatic factors that impose direct physiological challenges to survival or that restrict the ability to forage. A more thorough description of the migration patterns of most species will be required to distinguish effectively among these hypotheses. We identify research avenues that would broaden our understanding of bat migration patterns and provide critical information required for effective conservation.","2013","2024-11-14 21:42:14","2024-11-14 21:42:22","2024-11-14 21:42:14","767-786","","4","88","","","Altitudinal migration in bats","","","","","","","en","© 2013 The Authors.

As our understanding improves, it is not surprising there should be attempts at synthesizing our knowledge to prioritize future research directions (e.g., Hayes 2003, Miller et al. 2003). Miller et al. (2003) reviewed results of 56 papers (1980–2001) and concluded that current data were unreliable because of small sample sizes, the short-term nature of studies, pseudoreplication, inferences beyond the scale of data collected, study design, and limitations of bat detectors and statistical analyses. Our concern is that this type of narrative synthesis that highlights limitations ignores any quantitative patterns that may exist. In this study we assess whether general patterns in North American bat use of roost trees and stand characteristics are robust enough to distill from the published literature. We used a series of meta-analyses on the same set of studies cited by Miller et al. (2003) to assess whether limitations of the current data warrant exclusion of bats from management recommendations. We used a second series of meta-analyses incorporating more recent data to determine the best current synthesis of knowledge on bat use of forests for roosting. In a third and fourth series of meta-analyses, we separated studies done on bats roosting in cavities versus roosting in foliage. In general, we found that, relative to other trees in the forest, the roost trees of bats were tall with large DBH in stands with open canopy and high snag density. In contrast, roost trees of bats did not differ from random trees with respect to live-tree density. The main differences we detected between foliage-and cavity-roosting bats were in percent canopy cover and distance to water. The roost trees of cavity-roosting species had more open canopies and were closer to water than random trees. Our results clearly show that significant patterns can be detected from the literature when data sets are combined using a meta-analytic approach.","2005","2024-11-14 21:52:37","2024-11-14 21:52:42","2024-11-14 21:52:37","1123-1132","","3","33","","","Tree roost selection by bats","","","","","","","en","2005 The Wildlife Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2193/0091-7648%282005%2933%5B1123%3ATRSBBA%5D2.0.CO%3B2","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\A2JJVRR6\Kalcounis-Rüppell et al. - 2005 - Tree roost selection by bats an empirical synthesis using meta-analysis.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\WTGA74TY\0091-7648(2005)33[1123TRSBBA]2.0.html","","","Chiroptera; bats; North America; meta-analysis; roosts; forest-roosting bats; habitat management; roost selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acoustic surveys are increasingly used to monitor biodiversity change, especially for bats as they are important indicator species and most use sound to detect, localise and classify objects. However, using bat acoustic surveys for monitoring poses several challenges, particularly in megadiverse regions. Many species lack reference recordings, some species have high call similarity or differ in call detectability, and quantitative classification tools, such as machine learning algorithms, have rarely been applied to data from these areas. Here, we collate a reference call library for bat species that occur in a megadiverse country, Mexico. We use 4685 search-phase calls from 1378 individual sequences of 59 bat species to create automatic species identification tools generated by machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). We evaluate the improvement in species-level classification rates gained by using hierarchical classifications, reflecting either taxonomic or ecological constraints (guilds) on call design, and examine how classification rate accuracy changes at different hierarchical levels (family, genus and guild). Species-level classification of calls had a mean accuracy of 66%, and the use of hierarchies improved mean species-level classification accuracy by up to 6% (species within families 72%, species within genera 71·2% and species within guilds 69·1%). Classification accuracy to family, genus and guild-level was 91·7%, 77·8% and 82·5%, respectively. The bioacoustic identification tools we have developed are accurate for rapid biodiversity assessments in a megadiverse region and can also be used effectively to classify species at broader taxonomic or ecological levels. This flexibility increases their usefulness when there are incomplete species reference recordings and also offers the opportunity to characterise and track changes in bat community structure. Our results show that bat bioacoustic surveys in megadiverse countries have more potential than previously thought to monitor biodiversity changes and can be used to direct further developments of bioacoustic monitoring programs in Mexico.","2016","2024-11-14 22:07:18","2024-11-14 22:07:21","2024-11-14 22:07:18","1082-1091","","9","7","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2016 The Authors.

In addition, hundreds of more viruses are described without any information on zoonotic potential. We discuss important characteristics of bats including bat biology, evolution, distribution and ecology that not only make them unique among most mammals but also contribute to their potential as viral reservoirs. The detection of a virus in bats does not imply that spillover will occur and several biological, ecological and anthropogenic factors play a role in such an event. We summarize and critically analyse the current knowledge on African bats as reservoirs for corona-, filo-, paramyxo- and lyssaviruses. We highlight that important information on epidemiology, bat biology and ecology is often not available to make informed decisions on zoonotic spillover potential. Even if knowledge gaps exist, it is still important to recognize the role of bats in zoonotic disease outbreaks and implement mitigation strategies to prevent exposure to infectious agents including working safely with bats. Equally important is the crucial role of bats in various ecosystem services. This necessitates a multidisciplinary One Health approach to close knowledge gaps and ensure the development of responsible mitigation strategies to not only minimize risk of infection but also ensure conservation of the species.","2020","2024-11-12 21:45:26","2024-11-20 19:35:20","2024-11-14 22:09:03","77-98","","2","311","","","Bat-borne viruses in Africa","","","","","","","en","© 2020 The Zoological Society of London","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jzo.12769","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\U5NLNH6Y\Markotter et al. - 2020 - Bat-borne viruses in Africa a critical review.pdf","","","bats; Africa; coronavirus; Ebola; filovirus; henipavirus; paramyxovirus; rabies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location North America and Europe. Methods We used four decades of population counts from 1108 populations to compare the local abundances of bats in North America before and after the emergence of white-nose syndrome to the situation in Europe, where the disease is endemic. We also examined the probability of local extinction for six species of hibernating bats in eastern North America and assessed the influence of winter colony size prior to the emergence of white-nose syndrome on the risk of local extinction. Results White-nose syndrome has caused a 10-fold decrease in the abundance of bats at hibernacula in North America, eliminating large differences in species abundance patterns that existed between Europe and North America prior to disease emergence. White-nose syndrome has also caused extensive local extinctions (up to 69% of sites in a single species). For five out of six species, the risk of local extinction was lower in larger winter populations, as expected from theory, but for the most affected species, the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), extinction risk was constant across winter colony sizes, demonstrating that disease can sometimes eliminate numerical rarity as the dominant driver of extinction risk by driving both small and large populations extinct. Main conclusions Species interactions, including disease, play an underappreciated role in macroecological patterns and influence broad patterns of species abundance, occurrence and extinction.","2015","2024-11-14 22:10:37","2024-11-14 22:10:37","2024-11-14 22:10:37","741-749","","7","24","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.12290","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\GIVUPHKI\Frick et al. - 2015 - Disease alters macroecological patterns of North American bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\BA5FAZUF\geb.html","","","extinction risk; macroecology; Pseudogymnoascus destructans; white-nose syndrome; population monitoring; Disease ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used Bayesian hierarchical models to test four competing hypotheses for spatiotemporal variation in body size within 20 bat species across North America: (1) the heat conservation hypothesis, which posits that increased body size facilitates body heat conservation (and which is the traditional explanation for the mechanism underlying Bergmann's rule); (2) the heat mortality hypothesis, which posits that increased body size increases susceptibility to acute heat stress; (3) the resource availability hypothesis, which posits that increased body size is enabled in areas with more abundant food; and (4) the starvation resistance hypothesis, which posits that increased body size reduces susceptibility to starvation during acute food shortages. Spatial variation in body mass was most consistently (and negatively) correlated with mean annual temperature, supporting the heat conservation hypothesis. Across time, variation in body mass was most consistently (and positively) correlated with net primary productivity, supporting the resource availability hypothesis. Climate change could influence body size in animals through both changes in mean annual temperature and resource availability. Rapid reductions in body size associated with increasing temperatures have occurred in short-lived, fecund species, but such reductions will be obscured by changes in resource availability in longer-lived, less fecund species.

The distribution of body sizes among mammalian species has been modelled by Brown, Marquet & Taper (1993), who suggest that reproductive power (the rate at which energy from the environment is channelled into offspring production) is maximized at a size of 100 g, and the observed size distribution among species reflects the way reproductive power depends on size. The model makes a testable prediction about life-history allometries: namely, that components of reproductive power should not scale linearly with body size but should change sign at the optimum size. 2. A large set of life-history data from a single clade of small mammals, the bats (Order: Chiroptera), was analysed to test this key prediction. The analyses in this study offer no support for the idea that allometries of reproductive power change sign in bats, either at 100 g or at any other size. Furthermore the life-history allometries of bats, which are mostly below the 100 g optimum, were broadly the same as in mammalian taxa larger than the optimum size. 3. These findings together contradict a key prediction of Brown et al.’s (1993) model to explain the skewed body size distribution across mammalian species.","1997","2024-11-14 22:15:29","2024-11-14 22:15:29","2024-11-14 22:15:29","751-756","","6","11","","","An optimum body size for mammals?","","","","","","","en","1997 British Ecological Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2435.1997.00149.x","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\ZSQBPWKH\Jones y Purvis - 1997 - An optimum body size for mammals Comparative evidence from bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\JZQMBVRP\j.1365-2435.1997.00149.html","","","life history; Chiroptera; independent contrasts; Body size distribution; reproductive power","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many species are known to use ephemeral and/or unpredictable resources that require substantial investment to find and defend, and also engage in social interactions, thus requiring significant levels of social coordination. To accomplish these tasks, bats must be able to communicate; there is now substantial evidence that demonstrates the complexity of bat communication and the varied ways in which bats solve some of the problems associated with their unique life histories. However, while the study of communication in bats is rapidly growing, it still lags behind other taxa. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of communication in bats, from the reasons why they communicate to the diversity and application of different signal modalities. The most widespread form of communication is the transmission of a signaller's characteristics, such as species identity, sex, individual identity, group membership, social status and body condition, and because many species of bats can rely little on vision due to their nocturnal lifestyles, it is assumed that sound and olfaction are particularly important signalling modes. For example, research suggests that secretions from specialized glands, often in combination with urine and saliva, are responsible for species recognition in several species. These olfactory signals may also convey information about sex and colony membership. Olfaction may be used in combination with sound, particularly in species that emit constant frequency (CF) echolocation calls, to recognize conspecifics from heterospecifics, yet their simple structure and high frequency do not allow much information of individual identity to be conveyed over long distances. By contrast, social calls may encode a larger number of cues of individual identity, and their lower frequencies increase their range of detection. Social calls are also known to deter predators, repel competitors from foraging patches, attract group mates to roost sites, coordinate foraging activities, and are used during courtship. In addition to sound, visual displays such as wing flapping or hovering may be used during courtship, and swarming around roost sites may serve as a visual cue of roost location. However, visual communication in bats still remains a poorly studied signal modality. Finally, the most common form of tactile communication known in bats is social grooming, which may be used to signal reproductive condition, but also to facilitate and strengthen cooperative interactions. Overall, this review demonstrates the rapid advances made in the study of bat social communication during recent years, and also identifies topics that require further study, particularly those that may allow us to understand adaptation to rapidly changing environmental conditions.","2018","2024-01-18 18:38:18","2024-11-20 20:25:20","2024-11-14 22:20:35","1938-1954","","4","93","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12427","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\W7TM8UP8\Chaverri et al. - 2018 - Social communication in bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\R92BFXQH\Chaverri et al. - 2018 - Social communication in bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\LGY7A2GM\brv.html","","","Chiroptera; behaviour; information; signals; sociality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although it is considered a cost-effective method compared to Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT) tags, direct injuries from using forearm rings have been reported since their very first use. Yet, their impact on bats' welfare has not been systematically evaluated and remains a highly controversial issue among the scientific community and policymakers. Here we assess the impact of forearm rings and PIT tags on the health of different bat species. We reviewed 12 years of the existing recapture data of free-ranging bats from NE Spain and evaluated the impact of both marking tools in a captive colony of Carollia perspicillata, by assessing the development of skin lesions and levels of cortisol metabolites in guano (CG) after marking. We report that 55.1 % (435/790) of the recaptured free-ranging bats with forearm rings presented skin lesions. All banded C. perspicillata (n = 22, 100 %) developed skin lesions, whereas none of the PIT-tagged (n = 21) presented lesions. Levels of CG were significantly higher after marking with forearm rings only for one group. Banded C. perspicillata exhibited discomfort-associated behaviours due to forearm rings. Under the “precautionary principle”, we recommend the ban of forearm rings for all bat species until species-specific studies under controlled conditions are performed and approved by a legally constituted ethics committee. Consideration of other long-term marking tools is mandatory to align with global bat conservation strategies.","2023-10-01","2024-03-22 21:14:31","2024-11-20 20:25:29","2024-11-14 22:25:06","110268","","","286","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\YB9296YP\Lobato-Bailón et al. - 2023 - Reappraising the use of forearm rings for bat species.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\N6AX8M2Z\S0006320723003695.html; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\CUVTVJIP\Lobato-Bailón et al. - 2023 - Reappraising the use of forearm rings for bat spec.pdf","","","Conservation; Animal welfare; Bat; Forearm ring; PIT tag","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Together, these studies examined 10,186 bats, of which 10.8% had alopecia, with a sex bias to females (3:1). Most studies did not identify a specific ethologic agent responsible for the hair loss. However, alopecia was attributed to five non-exclusive causes: endocrine factors related to reproduction and lactation, ectoparasites, the ingestion of toxins, and environmental stress. In the latter, anthropogenic stressors are of increasing concern — the incidence of alopecia in urban areas reflects reproductive stress, limited food availability, roost disturbance, and pollution in these poor-quality environments. Better reporting of alopecia in bats would help us better understand this pathology and to precisely measure environmental stress in these animals.","2022-08","2024-11-14 22:27:01","2024-11-14 22:27:06","2024-11-14 22:27:01","209-219","","1","24","","acta","","","","","","","","","","","","","bioone.org","","Publisher: Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\P7HEXYXH\Martin-Regalado et al. - 2022 - Alopecia in Bats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fortunately, there are some signs of recovery; for instance, of the 11 species monitored in the UK, population trends of five are increasing. The drivers of past losses and recent trends are unclear; identifying them will enable targeted conservation strategies to support further recovery. We review the evidence linking proposed drivers to impacts on bat populations in Europe, using the results of a previous cross-taxa semi-quantitative assessment as a framework. Broadly, the drivers reviewed relate to land-use practices, climate change, pollution, development and infrastructure, and human disturbance. We highlight where evidence gaps or conflicts present barriers to successful conservation and review emerging opportunities to address these gaps. We find that the relative importance or impacts of the potential drivers of bat population change are not well understood or quantified, with conflicting evidence in many cases. To close key gaps in the evidence for responses of bat populations to environmental change, future studies should focus on the impacts of climate change, urbanisation, offshore wind turbines, and water pollution, as well as on mitigation measures and the synergistic effects of putative drivers. To increase available evidence of drivers of bat population change, we propose utilising advances in monitoring tools and statistical methods, together with robust quantitative assessment of conservation interventions to mitigate threats and enable the effective conservation of these protected species.","2021","2024-11-12 22:21:47","2024-11-25 20:52:34","2024-11-14 22:30:36","353-368","","3","51","","","Drivers of European bat population change","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Authors.

Such long-term negativity towards bats is now further exacerbated by more recent disease-related concerns, particularly associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic. There remains an urgent need to investigate and highlight the positive and beneficial aspects of bats across the Old World. While previous reviews have summarised these extensively, numerous new studies conducted over the last 36 years have provided further valuable data and insights which warrant an updated review. Here we synthesise research on pteropodid-plant interactions, comprising diet, ecological roles, and ecosystem services, conducted during 1985-2020. We uncovered a total of 311 studies covering 75 out of the known 201 pteropodid species (37%), conducted in 47 countries. The majority of studies documented diet (52% of all studies; 67 pteropodid species), followed by foraging movement (49%; 50 pteropodid species), with fewer studies directly investigating the roles played by pteropodids in seed dispersal (24%; 41 pteropodid species), pollination (14%; 19 pteropodid species), and conflict with fruit growers (12%; 11 pteropodid species). Pteropodids were recorded feeding on 1072 plant species from 493 genera and 148 families, with fruits comprising the majority of plant parts consumed, followed by flowers/nectar/pollen, leaves, and other miscellaneous parts. Sixteen pteropodid species have been confirmed to act as pollinators for a total of 21 plant species, and 29 pteropodid species have been confirmed to act as seed dispersers for a total of 311 plant species. Anthropogenic threats disrupting bat-plant interactions in the Old World include hunting, direct persecution, habitat loss/disturbance, invasive species, and climate change, leading to ecosystem-level repercussions.

Mammalian home range size has been linked to body size and diet, but these studies were based predominantly on terrestrial species and most specifically excluded bats. As the only group of flying mammals, bats experience distinctly different constraints on movement, and hence home range. However, despite their diversity, relatively little is known about the home ranges of bats, and this is the first global review assessing correlates of their home range size. Our hypothesis is that home range will be impacted by different ecological conditions experienced by the bats and by the biological traits of the bats themselves. We performed a meta-analysis based on published data for 81 bat species to identify variables that contribute most to home range size. Sex, wing loading, functional group, colony size, dietary class, distance from the equator (latitudinal region), habitat type, and the interaction between habitat type and latitudinal region were all important explanatory variables. Wing loading was positively correlated with home range size—while females, open-air foragers, large colony sizes, and bats in temperate regions consistently had large home ranges. Understanding the correlates of home range has important implications, for example, for bat conservation and for assessing the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens from bats to humans and livestock.","2024-10-01","2024-09-19 23:48:15","2024-11-25 20:45:31","2024-11-14 22:37:06","1044-1056","","5","105","","Journal of Mammalogy","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\SS3XPVH8\7664666.html","","To Read","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is crucial for climate change mitigation, but it also accelerates the degradation of biodiversity through habitat loss and the displacement of wildlife. To understand the extent of displacement and reasons for observations where no displacement is reported, we conducted a systematic review of birds, bats, and terrestrial mammals. Eighty-four peer-reviewed studies of onshore wind power yielded 160 distinct displacement distances, termed cases. For birds, bats, and mammals, 63 %, 72 %, and 67 % of cases respectively reported displacement. Cranes (3/3 cases), owls (2/2), and semi-domestic reindeer (6/6) showed consistent displacement on average up to 5 km. Gallinaceus birds showed displacement on average up to 5 km, but in 7/18 cases reported to show “no displacement”. Bats were displaced on average up to 1 km in 21/29 cases. Waterfowl (6/7 cases), raptors (24/30), passerines (16/32) and waders (8/19) were displaced on average up to 500 m. Observations of no displacement were suggested to result from methodological deficiencies, species-specific characteristics, and habitat conditions favorable for certain species after wind power development. Displacement-induced population decline could be mitigated by situating wind power in low-quality habitats, minimizing the small-scale habitat loss and collisions, and creating high-quality habitats to compensate for habitat loss. This review provides information on distance thresholds that can be employed in the design of future wind energy projects. However, most studies assessed the effects of turbine towers of <100 m high, while considerably larger turbines are being built today.","2023-12-01","2024-11-20 20:47:13","2024-11-20 20:47:23","2024-11-20 20:47:13","110382","","","288","","Biological Conservation","How far are birds, bats, and terrestrial mammals displaced from onshore wind power development?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\IJ6F7M4G\S0006320723004834.html; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\U8F9H2GM\Tolvanen et al. - 2023 - How far are birds, bats, and terrestrial mammals displaced from onshore wind power development – A.pdf","","","Biodiversity; Avoidance; Land use; Mitigation; Renewable energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their propensity to harbor viruses lethal to humans and/or livestock, mostly in absence of clinical disease, makes bats stand out among mammals. Defending against pathogens relies on avoidance, resistance, and/or tolerance strategies. In bats, disease tolerance has recently gained increasing attention as a prevailing host defense paradigm. We here summarize the current knowledge on immune responses in bats in the context of infection with zoonotic agents and discuss concepts related to disease tolerance. Acknowledging the wide diversity of bats, the broad spectrum of bat-associated microbial species, and immune-related knowledge gaps, we identify research priorities necessary to provide evidence-based proofs for disease tolerance in bats. Since disease tolerance relies on networks of biological processes, we emphasize that investigations beyond the immune system, using novel technologies and computational biology, could jointly advance our knowledge about mechanisms conferring bats reservoir abilities. Although disease tolerance may not be the “one fit all” defense strategy, deciphering disease tolerance in bats could translate into novel therapies and inform prevention of spillover infections to humans and livestock.","2024-09-05","2024-11-20 20:48:37","2024-11-20 20:48:37","2024-11-20 20:48:37","e1012471","","9","20","","PLOS Pathogens","Disease tolerance as immune defense strategy in bats","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\V8D8UGQT\Pei et al. - 2024 - Disease tolerance as immune defense strategy in bats One size fits all.pdf","","","Bats; Fruit bats; Immune response; Inflammasomes; Inflammatory diseases; Interferons; Pathogens; Toll-like receptors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike some common laboratory species, they meet a central criterion for aging studies: they live for a long time in the wild or in captivity, for 20, 30, and even >40 years. Healthy aging (i.e., healthspan) in bats has drawn attention to their potential to improve the lives of aging humans due to bat imperviousness to viral infections, apparent low rate of tumorigenesis, and unique ability to repair DNA. At the same time, bat longevity also permits the accumulation of age-associated systemic pathologies that can be examined in detail and manipulated, especially in captive animals. Research has uncovered additional and critical advantages of bats. In multiple ways, bats are better analogs to humans than are rodents. In this review, we highlight eight diverse areas of bat research with relevance to aging: genome sequencing, telomeres, and DNA repair; immunity and inflammation; hearing; menstruation and menopause; skeletal system and fragility; neurobiology and neurodegeneration; stem cells; and senescence and mortality. These examples demonstrate the broad relevance of the bat as an animal model and point to directions that are particularly important for human aging studies.","2024-10-04","2024-11-20 20:48:54","2024-11-20 20:48:54","","","","","","","Ann N Y Acad Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 39365995","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39365995","","Chiroptera; hearing; immunity; lifespan; neural system; reproductive physiology; skeletal system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ecologists have long used the physical linkage between morphology and energy balance to explain why the body size and shape of many organisms vary across climatic gradients, e.g., why larger endotherms are more common in colder regions. However, few modeling exercises have aimed at investigating this link from first principles. Body size evolution in bats contrasts with the patterns observed in other endotherms, probably because physical constraints on flight limit morphological adaptations. Here, we develop a biophysical model based on heat transfer and aerodynamic principles to investigate energy constraints on morphological evolution in bats. Our biophysical model predicts that the energy costs of thermoregulation and flight, respectively, impose upper and lower limits on the relationship of wing surface area to body mass (S-MR), giving rise to an optimal S-MR at which both energy costs are minimized. A comparative analysis of 278 species of bats supports the model’s prediction that S-MR evolves toward an optimal shape and that the strength of selection is higher among species experiencing greater energy demands for thermoregulation in cold climates. Our study suggests that energy costs modulate the mode of morphological evolution in bats—hence shedding light on a long-standing debate over bats’ conformity to ecogeographical patterns observed in other mammals—and offers a procedure for investigating complex macroecological patterns from first principles.","2022-04-12","2024-11-20 21:04:35","2024-11-20 21:04:35","2024-11-20 21:04:35","e2103745119","","15","119","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","pnas.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\723LS2ZT\Rubalcaba et al. - 2022 - Physical constraints on thermoregulation and flight drive morphological evolution in bats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These pathogens are occasionally transmitted from bats to wildlife, livestock, and to humans, directly or through other bridging (intermediate) hosts. Due to their public health relevance, zoonotic viruses are a primary focus of research attention. In contrast, other emerging pathogens of bats, such as bacteria, are vastly understudied despite their ubiquity and diversity. Here, we describe the currently known host ranges and geographic distributional patterns of potentially zoonotic bacterial genera in bats, using published presence-absence data of pathogen occurrence. We identify apparent gaps in our understanding of the distribution of these pathogens on a global scale. The most frequently detected bacterial genera in bats are Bartonella, Leptospira, and Mycoplasma. However, a wide variety of other potentially zoonotic bacterial genera are also occasionally found in bats, such as Anaplasma, Brucella, Borrelia, Coxiella, Ehrlichia, Francisella, Neorickettsia, and Rickettsia. The bat families Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Pteropodidae are most frequently reported as hosts of bacterial pathogens; however, the presence of at least one bacterial genus was confirmed in all 15 bat families tested. On a spatial scale, molecular diagnostics of samples from 58 countries and four overseas departments and island states (French Guiana, Mayotte, New Caledonia, and Réunion Island) reported testing for at least one bacterial pathogen in bats. We also identified geographical areas that have been mostly neglected during bacterial pathogen research in bats, such as the Afrotropical region and Southern Asia. Current knowledge on the distribution of potentially zoonotic bacterial genera in bats is strongly biased by research effort towards certain taxonomic groups and geographic regions. Identifying these biases can guide future surveillance efforts, contributing to a better understanding of the ecoepidemiology of zoonotic pathogens in bats.","2023","2024-11-11 20:32:30","2024-11-20 21:25:30","2024-11-20 21:12:53","9285855","","1","2023","","","Trends in Bacterial Pathogens of Bats","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2023 Tamara Szentivanyi et al.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1155/2023/9285855","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\3SDAXXCG\Szentivanyi et al. - 2023 - Trends in Bacterial Pathogens of Bats Global Distribution and Knowledge Gaps.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\XCDNEGYE\9285855.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research on bat-borne viruses attracted significant attention in recent years mainly due to epizootics caused by viruses having bats as hosts. The characterization of the viral communities of bats was then prioritized, but despite increasing efforts, there are large disparities in the geographical ranges covered and the methodologies employed around the world. As a result, large gaps remain in our current understanding of bat viromes and their role in disease emergence. This is particularly true for megadiverse regions in Latin America. This review aims to summarize the current understanding about bat viruses that inhabit Brazilian biomes, one of the most bat species-rich and diverse regions of the globe. Taking into account all known bat-associated viral families studied in Brazilian biomes, we found that almost half of all bat species (86/181 species) were not investigated for viruses at all. Moreover, only a small fraction of viral lineages or families have been studied more in depth, usually employing targeted methods with limited power to characterize a broad virus diversity. Additionally, these studies relied on limited spatiotemporal sampling and small sample sizes. Therefore, our current understanding of bat viral communities in the Brazilian biomes is limited and biased at different levels, limiting zoonotic risk assessments of bat-borne viruses. Considering these limitations, we propose strategies to bridge the existing gaps in the near future. IMPORTANCE Bat-borne viruses have attracted much attention due to zoonotic outbreaks with large consequences to humans. Because of that, virus characterization in bats has been prioritized in tropical regions of the globe. However, bat-virus research in Latin America and particularly in Brazil, which are among the most bat species-rich regions of the world, are highly biased toward zoonotic viruses and known bat reservoir species. These results have direct implication for virus studies in general but also for new zoonotic virus and spillover events characterization. The limited knowledge we currently have about the virome of Brazilian bats drastically limits any broad assessment of zoonotic viruses they carry and calls for coordinated and large-scale studies to fill this crucial knowledge gap.","2023-01-10","2024-11-11 22:15:57","2024-11-20 21:25:27","2024-11-20 21:17:30","e04077-22","","1","11","","","The Virome of Bats Inhabiting Brazilian Biomes","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.asm.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Society for Microbiology","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\QE69XTN5\Wallau et al. - 2023 - The Virome of Bats Inhabiting Brazilian Biomes Knowledge Gaps and Biases towards Zoonotic Viruses.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whilst energy conservation is beneficial in itself, it is less clear whether hibernation confers wider conservation benefits or mitigates or exacerbates a wide range of threats. We briefly review how hibernation manifests in mammalian biology, primarily through energy budgets, activity levels and resource requirements, but then ask how these interact with existing pressures to affect conservation risk. We also explore conservation actions that could alleviate the negative relations between some pressures and hibernation biology and review the available evidence for these measures. Hibernation can convey some protection from disease and predation, though there are notable exceptions, for example white-nose syndrome. There is well-established evidence that hibernators are prone to hazards of disturbance during hibernation, necessitating careful mitigation. Hibernators exhibit diverse responses to the pressures related to climate change, including temperature variability and phenological and range mismatches. Yet for each aspect, there are examples of species and populations responding negatively, such as with reduced survival, which suggests that hibernation could exacerbate the negative consequences of climate change. Though there are times when hibernators do not respond as expected, we find several positive conservation actions, such as modern grilles and regulations reducing the disturbance of cave-hibernating bat species. Understanding and working with hibernation biology can, therefore, successfully mitigate the additional risks it confers.","2024","2024-11-11 22:20:39","2024-11-20 21:25:01","2024-11-20 21:18:02","310-324","","3","54","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Authors.

Bats are sensitive to climate change due to their dependence on temperature during critical life stages. However, long-term studies documenting responses over extended periods are rare. We present a 24-year investigation of Myotis daubentonii, a riparian bat known for altitudinal sexual segregation, along a river course in Central Italy. While males occupy the entire river course, females are confined to downstream warmer areas supporting successful reproduction due to improved foraging site productivity. In 2000, females were absent above 900 m a.s.l in our study area. We hypothesise that a) this altitude threshold is now higher, due to thermal gradient changes along the river course; and b) thermoregulatory costs for reproductive females have declined, leading to increased energy investment in offspring and subsequent generational growth in bat body size. Confirming our hypotheses, females exhibited a 175-m upward shift in altitude limit. Furthermore, we found a concurrent increase in body size (but not condition). Temperatures increased in the 24 years, likely allowing females to extend their range to higher elevations and favouring an increase in newborn body mass. Riparian vegetation remained unchanged, excluding habitat quality changes as the cause for the observed responses. The rapid female elevation rise might imply future disruption of established social structures, altering intra- and intersexual competition for roosts and food. Given the global decline in insect populations, larger bats might face future difficulties in finding food to sustain their body size, increasing mortality. However, the full impact of such changes on bat fitness remains unexplored and warrants further investigation, including other bat populations. This knowledge is crucial for informing conservation in the face of ongoing climate change and preserving the ecosystem services bats deliver in riparian ecosystems.","2024-02-25","2024-11-11 22:21:50","2024-11-20 21:25:18","2024-11-20 21:18:42","169733","","","913","","Science of The Total Environment","Higher and bigger","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\EUAZ72J3\Russo et al. - 2024 - Higher and bigger How riparian bats react to climate change.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\PKR7SIHW\S0048969723083638.html","","","Chiroptera; Body size; Altitude; Climate change; Riparian ecosystems; Temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to characterise this trade by sampling two major e-commerce platforms over an 18-month period. We used an automated pipeline, whereby data were accessed programmatically; filtered using a neural-network classifier; and the locations and species mentioned in relevant listings were identified using Named Entity Recognition. We retrieved 40,412 relevant results, representing 2363 and 2116 unique listings from Etsy and eBay, respectively. Although the accuracy of listings could not be verified, most (57 %) provided species-level information. Hence, 47 bat species were listed for sale, of which 32 are not currently identified by the IUCN Red List as traded for any purpose. The highest number of listings were sold from USA, Hong Kong and the UK, whilst traded species' ranges were predominantly located in South East Asia. We provide one of the first longitudinal datasets on the online bat trade, indicating that several species are being traded at potentially high volumes, with demand from North America and Europe driving exploitation in South East Asia. This is concerning for highly-traded species which occur at low densities, such as the painted wooly bat Kerivoula picta.

Following speciation, both intrinsic and extrinsic factors may determine how readily sympatry occurs. One possibility is that sympatry most readily occurs with ecological divergence, especially if broad-scale co-occurrence is mediated by niche differentiation. Time since divergence may also predict sympatry if hybridization and gene flow lead to the collapse of species boundaries between closely related taxa. Here, we test for ecological and phylogenetic predictors of sympatry across the global radiation of extant bats. Location Global. Taxon Bats (Order Chiroptera). Methods We used a combination of linear mixed-modelling, simulations and maximum-likelihood modelling to test whether phylogenetic and ecomorphological divergence between species predict sympatry. We further assess how these relationships vary based on biogeographic realm. Results We find that time since divergence does not predict sympatry in any biogeographic realm. Morphological divergence is negatively related to sympatry in the Neotropics, but shows no relationship with sympatry elsewhere. Main conclusions We find that bats in most biogeographic realms co-occur at broad spatial scales regardless of phylogenetic similarity. Neotropical bats, however, appear to co-occur most readily when morphologically similar. To the extent that pairwise phylogenetic and morphological divergence reflect ecological differentiation, our results suggest that abiotic and environmental factors may be more important than species interactions in determining patterns of sympatry across bats.","2018","2024-11-20 21:53:49","2024-11-20 21:53:49","2024-11-20 21:53:49","1560-1570","","7","45","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jbi.13353","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\4RBR5H5F\Shi et al. - 2018 - Ecomorphological and phylogenetic controls on sympatry across extant bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\WEGTTIED\jbi.html","","","evolutionary ecology; macroecology; Chiroptera; ecomorphology; macroevolution; sympatry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fungus is native to the Palearctic, where it also infects several bat species, yet rarely causes severe pathology or the death of the host. Pseudogymnoascus destructans infects bats during hibernation by invading and digesting the skin tissue, resulting in the disruption of torpor patterns and consequent emaciation. Relations among pathogen, host, and environment are complex, and individuals, populations, and species respond to the fungal pathogen in different ways. For example, the Nearctic Myotis lucifugus responds to infection by mounting a robust immune response, leading to immunopathology often contributing to mortality. In contrast, the Palearctic M. myotis shows no significant immunological response to infection. This lack of a strong response, resulting from the long coevolution between the hosts and the pathogen in the pathogen's native range, likely contributes to survival in tolerant species. After more than 15 years since the initial introduction of the fungus to North America, some of the affected populations are showing signs of recovery, suggesting that the fungus, hosts, or both are undergoing processes that may eventually lead to coexistence. The suggested or implemented management methods of the disease in North America have encompassed, for example, the use of probiotics and fungicides, vaccinations, and modifying the environmental conditions of the hibernation sites to limit the growth of the pathogen, intensity of infection, or the hosts’ responses to it. Based on current knowledge from Eurasia, policy makers and conservation managers should refrain from disrupting the ongoing evolutionary processes and adopt a holistic approach to managing the epizootic.","2024","2024-11-20 22:21:21","2025-01-08 21:55:40","2024-11-20 22:21:21","e14265","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Authors.

Quantitative threat assessment often requires monitoring programs that provide reliable data over relevant spatial and temporal scales, yet such programs can be difficult to justify until there is an apparent stressor. Leveraging efforts of wildlife management agencies to record winter counts of hibernating bats, we collated data for 5 species from over 200 sites across 27 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces from 1995 to 2018 to determine the impact of white-nose syndrome (WNS), a deadly disease of hibernating bats. We estimated declines of winter counts of bat colonies at sites where the invasive fungus that causes WNS (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) had been detected to assess the threat impact of WNS. Three species undergoing species status assessment by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Myotis septentrionalis, Myotis lucifugus, and Perimyotis subflavus) declined by more than 90%, which warrants classifying the severity of the WNS threat as extreme based on criteria used by NatureServe. The scope of the WNS threat as defined by NatureServe criteria was large (36% of Myotis lucifugus range) to pervasive (79% of Myotis septentrionalis range) for these species. Declines for 2 other species (Myotis sodalis and Eptesicus fuscus) were less severe but still qualified as moderate to serious based on NatureServe criteria. Data-sharing across jurisdictions provided a comprehensive evaluation of scope and severity of the threat of WNS and indicated regional differences that can inform response efforts at international, national, and state or provincial jurisdictions. We assessed the threat impact of an emerging infectious disease by uniting monitoring efforts across jurisdictional boundaries and demonstrated the importance of coordinated monitoring programs, such as the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat), for data-driven conservation assessments and planning.","2021","2024-11-11 22:38:25","2024-11-21 21:42:55","2024-11-20 22:29:10","1586-1597","","5","35","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Authors.

In the included articles, 178 predation events, involving 52 predator and 84 prey species, were reported. In most of the reports, the mist nets were placed at ground level, the bats and birds were preyed on from the shelf closest to the ground, the mist-net checks occurred at intervals of 1 h or 30 min and the most common predators were arboreal and scansorial species (primates and marsupials). Despite the occurrences of predation in 13 countries, guidelines for best practice mist-net use were found in only three, despite extensive searches and contact with key people in each country. Based on the existing guidelines and our results, we recommend that mist nets be fixed with the lowest shelf at least 50 cm above ground level and be checked at 15-min intervals; when predators are observed near mist nets, the nets either be constantly observed, closed, or relocated; suppressed the vegetation around the mist nets; captured animals be removed from the mist nets as soon as possible, and more than one researcher/technician should be in the field at all times.","2023","2024-11-21 16:12:46","2024-11-21 16:12:46","2024-11-21 16:12:46","e10390","","8","13","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 The Authors.

From a conservation perspective, understanding the potentially negative and indirect effects of habitat destruction on animal microbiota can also play a crucial role in the conservation and management of the host itself. According to the One Health concept, which recognizes an interdependence between humans, animals, and the environment, bat microbiota represents an indicator of host and environmental health, besides allowing for evaluation of the risk of emerging infectious diseases. We noticed that a growing number of studies suggest that animal microbiota may respond in various ways to changes in land use, particularly when such changes lead to altered or deficient food resources. We have highlighted that the current literature is strongly focused on the initial phase of investigating the microbial communities found in Chiroptera from various habitats. However, there are gaps in effectively assessing the impacts of pathogens and microbial communities in general in animal conservation, veterinary, and public health. A deeper understanding of bat microbiomes is paramount to the implementation of correct habitat and host management and to the development of effective surveillance protocols worldwide.","2024-01","2024-11-21 16:16:31","2024-11-21 16:16:36","2024-11-21 16:16:31","3043","","20","14","","","Bat Ecology and Microbiome of the Gut","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 20 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\MENRDQIB\Bazzoni et al. - 2024 - Bat Ecology and Microbiome of the Gut A Narrative Review of Associated Potentials in Emerging and Z.pdf","","","<i>Chiroptera</i>; microbiome; pathogens; spillover; zoonotic diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The risk of zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium from bats to humans appears low, with bat-specific Cryptosporidium genotypes accounting for 91.5% of Cryptosporidium-positive samples genotyped from bats worldwide, and C. parvum and C. hominis accounting for 3.4% each of typed positives, respectively. To date, there have only been sporadic detections of Giardia in bats, with no genetic characterisation of the parasite to species or assemblage level. Therefore, the role bats play as reservoirs of zoonotic Giardia spp. is unknown.

Viruses, and other co-infecting agents, can interact in ways that shape host and agent communities, influence infection dynamics, and drive evolutionary selective pressures. Bats are host to many viruses of zoonotic potential and have drawn increasing attention in their role as wildlife reservoirs for human spillover. However, the role of co-infection in driving viral transmission dynamics within bats is unknown. Here, we systematically review peer-reviewed literature reporting viral co-infections in bats. We show that viral co-infection is common in bats but is often only reported as an incidental finding. Biases identified in our study database related to virus and host species were pre-existing in virus studies of bats generally. Studies largely speculated on the role co-infection plays in viral recombination and few investigated potential drivers or impacts of co-infection. Our results demonstrate that current knowledge of co-infection in bats is an ad hoc by-product of viral discovery efforts, and that future targeted co-infection studies will improve our understanding of the role it plays. Adding to the broader context of co-infection studies in other wildlife species, we anticipate our review will inform future co-infection study design and reporting in bats. Consideration of detection strategy, including potential viral targets, and appropriate analysis methodology will provide more robust results and facilitate further investigation of the role of viral co-infection in bat reservoirs.","2023-09","2024-11-21 16:17:51","2024-11-21 16:17:55","2024-11-21 16:17:51","1860","","9","15","","","Viral Co-Infection in Bats","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 9 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\B5W8GUWV\Jones et al. - 2023 - Viral Co-Infection in Bats A Systematic Review.pdf","","","wildlife; chiroptera; review; co-infection; coinfection; viral co-infection; viral dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the objective of this study was to carry out a worldwide systematic review of the occurrence of Leishmania species in bats, as well as to identify associations between eating habits and the type of sample collected with the occurrence of the infection. Data were obtained from a bibliographic search for studies that used molecular methods to identify parasites, employing the keywords ""bats"" AND ""Leishmania"" and their synonyms. We found 68 original studies, of which 20 were included in this review. Most studies were conducted in Brazil (60 %) and only 10 % were conducted in Old World countries. In all, 48 bat species were recorded that hosted seven Leishmania species, resulting in 62 different host-parasite interactions, and the Leishmania infantum interaction with bat species presented higher frequency. There was no significant difference between Leishmania species richness, infection percentage, and type of sample analyzed, but in general, it is observed that the use of different biological samples seems to expand the possibility of parasite detection. The patterns observed here indicate that bats can become infected with a wide variety of Leishmania species and likely play an important role in maintaining the parasite's life cycle. Thus, we suggest that studies aimed at understanding the transmission cycle of leishmaniasis include the investigation of bats as potential hosts or reservoirs of Leishmania.","2023-12-01","2024-11-21 16:18:45","2024-11-21 16:18:45","2024-11-21 16:18:45","107025","","","248","","Acta Tropica","<i>Leishmania</i> species infection of bats","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\CJE5TWPA\S0001706X23002127.html","","","Bat; Reservoir; Leishmania: Host; Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Derived largely from the influence of Western cultural perceptions, it ignores the diverse cultural perceptions of bats from other regions, which have been largely overlooked. To better understand local beliefs and cultural perceptions regarding bats across the Asia-Pacific region, and how they may help design culturally grounded conservation strategies, we conducted a review of publications in the English-language literature documenting cultural value of bats in Asia-Pacific traditions. We discovered 119 bat cultural values in 60 different cultures from 24 countries across the region and found a wide spectrum of reports, which we categorized according to five wildlife value categories and further categorized these values according to positive, neutral, and negative. We found that 62% of the cultures had only positive values, 8% had only neutral values, while 10% had only negative values. This suggests that the Asia-Pacific region and its cultures contain far more positive associations with bats than most Western societies and, as such, offer promising examples and opportunities to promote human-bat coexistence. However, we also discuss how local belief systems may not always align with daily practices or conservation objectives.

As anthropogenic change alters the distribution of this species, shifts in predator–prey interactions are expected. Understanding prey richness and patterns of prey selection is, thus, increasingly informative from ecological, epidemiological, and economic perspectives. We reviewed D. rotundus diet and assessed the geographical, taxonomical, and behavioral features to find 63 vertebrate species within 21 orders and 45 families constitute prey, including suitable host species in regions of invasion outside D. rotundus’ range. Rodentia contained the largest number of species utilized by D. rotundus, though cattle were the most commonly reported prey source, likely linked to the high availability of livestock and visibility of bite wounds compared to wildlife. Additionally, there was tendency to predate upon species with diurnal activity and social behavior, potentially facilitating convenient and nocturnal predation. Our review highlights the dietary heterogeneity of D. rotundus across its distribution. We define D. rotundus as a generalist predator, or parasite, depending on the ecological definition of its symbiont roles in an ecosystem (i.e., lethal vs. non-lethal blood consumption).

While recent studies have provided novel insight into bat-flower interactions, there are gaps in knowledge regarding their geographic distribution, the role of floral traits in ensuring attractiveness and mechanical fit to bats, and details of the structure of interaction networks between plants and bats. Here, we review bat pollination in the Caatinga, the largest and most diverse Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in the Neotropics, and a global hotspot for this pollination system. The first records of bat pollination date back less than 20 years and were mostly confined to a small area in the eastern part of the Caatinga. Over the last two decades, bat pollination has been confirmed for 22 genera of flowering plants from 12 families, through both direct observations and pollen records. Recent investigations of the floral biology of bat-pollinated plant species have revealed the role of floral traits such as styliflory, fragrant nectar, as well as white and greenish flowers without reflection in the ultraviolet range. Bat-pollinated plants in the Caatinga interact with at least 11 bat species (6 species of opportunistic and 5 species of specialized nectarivores). We list here another 126 Caatinga plant species that potentially might be bat-pollinated and should be targeted in future investigations. The high potential incidence of bat pollination (4.8% of the estimated flora) seems to be a peculiar feature of the Caatinga. We emphasize the urgency to perform nocturnal forays that will help to understand how bat pollination systems evolved in dry forests. This is particularly important because, similar to many other dry forests, the Caatinga is particularly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance and there is currently a considerable risk that many plant species will be lost before their pollination biology is fully understood.","2023-08-01","2024-11-21 19:30:00","2024-11-21 19:30:18","2024-11-21 19:30:00","152332","","","305","","Flora","Bat pollination in the Caatinga","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\ATLKKHWU\Domingos-Melo et al. - 2023 - Bat pollination in the Caatinga A review of studies and peculiarities of the system in the new worl.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\6EPWHBFM\S0367253023001226.html","","","Bat pollination; Caatinga dry forest; Chiropterophily; Floral trait; Nectarivorous bats; Seasonal dry tropical forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, they have rarely been used to study broad scale patterns of species traits. We assessed the potential of acoustic data to detect broad scale patterns in body size. We compared geographical patterns in body size with acoustic signals in the bat species Pipistrellus pipistrellus. Given the correlation between body size and acoustic characteristics, we expected to see similar results when analyzing the relationships of body size and acoustic signals with climatic variables. Methods We assessed body size using forearm length measurements of 1,359 bats, captured by mist nets in France. For acoustic analyses, we used an extensive dataset collected through the French citizen bat survey. We isolated each bat echolocation call (n = 4,783) and performed automatic measures of signals, including the frequency of the flattest part of the calls (characteristic frequency). We then examined the relationship between forearm length, characteristic frequencies, and two components resulting from principal component analysis for geographic (latitude, longitude) and climatic variables. Results Forearm length was positively correlated with higher precipitation, lower seasonality, and lower temperatures. Lower characteristic frequencies (i.e., larger body size) were mostly related to lower temperatures and northern latitudes. While conducted on different datasets, the two analyses provided congruent results. Discussion Acoustic data from citizen science programs can thus be useful for the detection of large-scale patterns in body size. This first analysis offers a new perspective for the use of large acoustic databases to explore biological patterns and to address both theoretical and applied questions.","2018-08-24","2024-09-19 23:51:17","2024-11-25 20:25:14","2024-11-21 22:21:36","e5370","","","6","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","peerj.com","","Publisher: PeerJ Inc.","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\IBY5BCSN\Penone et al. - 2018 - Body size information in large-scale acoustic bat databases.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\45URSZG7\Penone et al. - 2018 - Body size information in large-scale acoustic bat databases.pdf","","To Read","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heavy metal (HM) exposure is an emerging threat of great significance to bats, yet the toxicity threshold for most metallic elements remains unknown. The greatest diversity of bats worldwide is in the Neotropical region, where ecotoxicological studies are scarce. Thus, this review provides a current overview of the knowledge available on HMs contamination of Neotropical bats. Analysis of the results of 17 articles published between 2000 and 2023 documented a trend of increasing interest in the topic, although it is incipient and in few countries. Of the 226 species known for the Neotropics, 95 have been investigated for metal concentrations. Seven different matrices were used to assess concentrations of heavy metals in tissues, with fur being the subject of eight studies, highlighting the search for non-invasive analysis. Twenty-one HMs were detected in bats, with mercury being the most common. The highest concentrations of this HM were detected in insectivorous/omnivorous bats, highlighting its magnification in this trophic guild compared to frugivorous bats. Copper, lead, and cadmium did not differ significantly among the other trophic guilds. This review shows that there is knowledge about concentrations of heavy metals in several Neotropical species, but knowledge about the impact of these concentrations on bat health is limited, which highlights the need for research to determine critical concentrations that cause damage to bat health, and that guide conservation actions for their populations, as well as environmental monitoring actions for these pollutants.","2024-03-22","2024-11-11 22:17:18","2025-01-08 21:28:11","2024-11-25 20:23:15","391","","4","196","","Environ Monit Assess","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\GR6PZU7Z\Vidal et al. - 2024 - Ecotoxicology of heavy metal contamination of Neotropical bats.pdf","","","Bat health; Environment monitoring; Environmental Chemistry; Environmental pollutant; Mercury in bats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bats provide essential ecosystem services and a sustained, thriving population is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding issues threatening their survival is crucial for their protection and conservation. This paper provides the first review for 12years on organic pollutants in bats and aims to investigate trends and any new issues impacting bat resilience. Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been reported most often, especially in the older literature, with the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), present at highest concentrations in tissues analyzed. The OC pesticide concentrations reported in bat tissues have declined significantly since the late 1970s, presumably as a result of restrictions in use. For example, DDE study mean concentrations over time periods 1970–1980, 1981–1999 and 2000–2013 ranged from 2.6-62, 0.05–2.31, 0.08–0.19ppm wet weight, respectively. Exposure, however, still occurs from remaining residues, many years after the compounds have been actively used. In recent years (2000–2013), a range of other organic chemicals have been reported in bat tissues including brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ether at a mean concentration of 2.9ppm lipid weight) and perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanyl sulfonate at a mean concentration 0.09ppm wet weight). The persistent organic compounds concentrate in tissues with higher fat content notably back-depot fat. Numerous factors influence exposure, residues detected and concentrations in different individuals, species and tissues which must be understood to provide meaningful assessment of the impacts of exposure. Exposure can lead to not only acute and lethal impacts, but also physiological sub-lethal and chronic effects, often linked to the annual cycle of fat deposition and withdrawal. Current challenges for bat conservation include collation of a more extensive and standardized database of bat exposure, especially to current use pesticides and emerging contaminants, and better prediction and definition of toxicity end points notably for the sub-lethal effects. Understanding sub-lethal effects will be of greater importance for sustaining populations in the longer-term.","2014-02-01","2024-11-25 20:32:20","2024-11-25 20:32:45","2024-11-25 20:32:20","40-52","","","63","","Environment International","Organic contaminants in bats","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\AQ5Q8D7K\Bayat et al. - 2014 - Organic contaminants in bats Trends and new issues.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\LHGLE2YX\S0160412013002249.html","","To Read","Bats; Mortality; Organic contaminants; Pesticides","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a search for information on caves, mines, tunnels, and culverts used as roosts by bats in Mexico, in order to create an inventory and a database, as well as a list of priority sites for their protection. In total, 970 underground roosts have been reported: 73.7% are caves, 16.6% are mines, 5.2% are culverts, and 4.5% are tunnels. The roost sites are more commonly located in tropical deciduous forests (24%) and secondary vegetation modified by farming (18.5%). In 92% of underground roosts, the surrounding vegetation has been altered for several causes. Regarding internal disturbance, 46.6% of the 176 roost sites analyzed present little to no disturbance, 43.7% have moderate levels of disturbance, and 9.7% are highly disturbed. The use of underground roosts was documented for 88 bat species included in 44 genera and seven families.

Due in part to the unique adaptations of this group, bats are parasitized by many arthropod lineages, and the flies of the Streblidae and Nycteribiidae families are considered the most conspicuous. Network analysis is an approach that has been growing in recent decades and has contributed greatly to the understanding of ecological systems. The objective of this study is to analyze if the structure of the bat-ectoparasitic networks are consistent along a latitudinal gradient on a global scale. We searched the scientific literature for information about the relationship of bats and their ectoparasitic dipterans of Streblidae and Nycteribiidae using the Scopus, Google Scholar and PubMed databases. For each publication, nesting, connectivity, and modularity parameters were calculated for each network of bats and flies. In order to evaluate if the structure of the networks varies along the latitudinal gradient, we constructed generalized linear models. In general, we observed that the ectoparasite-bat interaction networks have a highly modular structure with low nesting and connectivity values, which is a pattern commonly presented by networks of antagonistic interactions. We also observed that the size of the network significantly influenced the nesting, connectivity and modularity, possibly due to the highly specialized nature of the ectoparasite-bat interaction. The latitude was positively correlated to the connectivity, which can be explained by the lower diversity observed in temperate regions.","2020-09","2024-11-25 20:35:03","2024-11-25 20:35:16","2024-11-25 20:35:03","187-196","","1","22","","acta","Structure of the Interaction Networks Between Bats (Mammalia","","","","","","","","","","","","bioone.org","","Publisher: Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\ZGYIDSP8\Júnior et al. - 2020 - Structure of the Interaction Networks Between Bats (Mammalia Chiroptera) and Ectoparasite Flies (Di.pdf","","To Read","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current urban ecology research has focused mostly on urban birds and plants, limiting our ability to make generalizations about the drivers of urban biodiversity globally. To address this gap, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 87 studies, including 180 bat species (Chiroptera) from urban areas in Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. We aimed to (i) understand the importance of functional traits and phylogeny in driving changes in urban bat assemblages, and (ii) assess the capacity of traits for predicting which types of species are most sensitive to urbanization. Our results indicate that species-specific functional traits explain differences in the intensity of urban habitat use. Urban tolerance mainly occurred within the open and edge space foraging and trawling species as well as in bats with flexible roosting strategies. In addition, across bioregions and independent of phylogeny, urban tolerance correlated with higher aspect ratio, a trait enabling fast flight but less agile manoeuvres during aerial food acquisition. Predictive success varied between bioregions, between 43 and 83%. Our analysis demonstrates that the local extinction of bat species in urban areas is non-random, trait-based and predictable, allowing urban landscape managers to tailor local conservation actions to particular types of species.","2018-08-22","2024-11-25 20:51:03","2024-11-25 20:51:19","2024-11-25 20:51:03","20181222","","1885","285","","","Trait-dependent tolerance of bats to urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\3UGGJC2G\Jung y Threlfall - 2018 - Trait-dependent tolerance of bats to urbanization a global meta-analysis.pdf","","To Read","conservation; biodiversity; functional traits; Chiroptera; meta-analysis; urban ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its rapid progress is mostly at the expense of natural ecosystems and the species inhabiting them. While some species can adjust quickly and thrive in cities, many others cannot. To support biodiversity conservation and guide management decisions in urban areas, it is important to find robust methods to estimate the urban affinity of species (i.e. their tendency to live in urban areas) and understand how it is associated with their traits. Since previous studies mainly relied on discrete classifications of species' urban affinity, often involving inconsistent assessments or variable parameters, their results were difficult to compare. To address this issue, we developed and evaluated a set of continuous indices that quantify species' urban affinity based on publicly available occurrence data. We investigated the extent to which a species' position along the urban affinity gradient depends on the chosen index and how this choice affects inferences about the relationship between urban affinity and a set of morphological, sensory and functional traits. While these indices are applicable to a wide range of taxonomic groups, we examined their performance using a global set of 356 bat species. As bats vary in sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbances, they provide an interesting case study. We found that different types of indices resulted in different rankings of species on the urban affinity spectrum, but this had little effect on the association of traits with urban affinity. Our results suggest that bat species predisposed to urban life are characterized by low echolocation call frequencies, relatively long call durations, small body size and flexibility in the selection of the roost type. We conclude that simple indices are appropriate and practical, and propose to apply them to more taxa to improve our understanding of how urbanization favours or filters species with particular traits.","2022","2024-11-25 21:00:56","2024-11-25 21:00:56","2024-11-25 21:00:56","5667-5682","","19","28","","","Urban affinity and its associated traits","","","","","","","en","© 2022 The Authors.

Despite being sensitive to water loss, bats successfully inhabit a wide range of arid lands. We here investigated how functional traits of bat assemblages vary along the global aridity gradient to identify traits that favour their persistence in arid environments. Location Global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Bats. Methods We mapped the assemblage-level averages of four key bat traits describing wing morphology, echolocation and body size, based on a grid of 100-km resolution and a pool of 915 bat species, and modelled them against aridity values. To support our results, we conducted analyses also at the species level to control for phylogenetic autocorrelation. Results At the assemblage level, we detected a rise in values of aspect ratio, wing loading and forearm length, and a decrease in echolocation frequency with increasing aridity. These patterns were consistent with trends detected at the species level for all traits. Main conclusions Our findings show that trait variation in bats is associated with the aridity gradient and suggest that greater mobility and larger body size are advantageous features in arid environments. Greater mobility favours bats’ ability to track patchy and temporary resources, while the reduced surface-to-volume ratio associated with a larger body size is likely to reduce water stress by limiting cutaneous evaporation. These findings highlight the importance of extending attention from species-specific adaptations to broad scale and multispecies variation in traits when investigating the ability of species to withstand arid conditions.","2021","2024-11-25 21:06:18","2024-11-25 21:06:40","2024-11-25 21:06:18","1014-1029","","5","30","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Authors.

Anthropogenic change negatively impacts surrounding landscapes, but in some cases, lead to an increase in synathropy. Bats are one such group that often take advantage of human altered landscapes, roosting in anthropogenic structures such as buildings and transportation infrastructure. However, less is known about how non-traditional or artificial roost sites may affect persistence of synathropic bat species. We conducted a literature review to evaluate the ecological relationship between bats and artificial roosts, specifically transportation structures, as they are often the only roost structures available in some landscapes. Our evaluation revealed that numerous studies on artificial roost selection have been conducted in the eastern region of North America, as well as abroad. Use of transportation structures by bats varies across landscapes, specifically due to variation in annual climate, availability of natural roosts, and bridge structure design. This review enhances our understanding of bat roost ecology, possible pitfalls of synanthropic behaviour, and identify trends related to bat-bridge associations that may improve conservation outcomes for synanthropic species.","2023-06-30","2024-11-25 21:27:10","2024-11-25 21:27:10","","135-157","","1","25","","Acta Chiropterologica","Wildlife Use of Anthropogenic Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","IngentaConnect","","","","","","","BRIDGES; CHIROPTERA; ECOLOGICAL SINK; HABITAT SELECTION; ROOSTS; SYNANTHROPIC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we analysed the hunting risk of 1320 bat species (of 1400 known) from around the world and explored the association between ecological traits and socioeconomic variables. Globally, at least 19 % of species are threatened by hunting. Large-bodied bats with narrow distributions are at increased risk of hunting, particularly in tropical regions. Multiple threats, such as habitat loss and modification, are likely to exacerbate the pressures experienced by hunted species. Furthermore, accessibility to bat habitats and low-income drive bat hunting in developing countries. With the global economic recession and the need for economic recovery following the pandemic, hunters may rely more on wildlife for subsistence and pose a threat to both biodiversity and public health. Achieving the balance between economics and conserving biodiversity is challenging due to socioeconomic factors, and the complex interplay of different forms of threat. Therefore, interventions to reduce bat hunting activities should include greater investment to facilitate sustainable livelihood development in the rural economy, and elevating public knowledge about bat ecosystem services, and their potential role in the transmission of zoonotic diseases.","2023-03-01","2024-01-30 20:03:20","2025-01-08 21:27:26","2024-11-25 21:36:06","109944","","","279","","Biological Conservation","Are we hunting bats to extinction?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\NXD2HW3N\Tanalgo et al. - 2023 - Are we hunting bats to extinction Worldwide patterns of hunting risk in bats are driven by species.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\IR8SHW9K\S0006320723000447.html","","","Anthropogenic threats; Covid-19; Redlist; Tropics; Wildmeat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Histoplasma species are thermally dimorphic fungi existing in mycelial form in the natural environment and in yeast form in infected tissues. In this narrative literature review, we summarize the occurrence of Histoplasma spp. in different species of bat tissues (n = 49) and in soil admixed with bat guano where the species of bat dwelling nearby has been identified (an additional 18 species likely infected) to provide an up-to-date summary of data. Most positive isolations are from the Americas and Caribbean, with some studies from Thailand, Malaysia, Nigeria, Slovenia, France, and Australia. We also summarize some of the early experimental work to elucidate pathogenicity, latency, immune response, and faecal excretion in bats. Given the recent recognition of the global extent of histoplasmosis, thermal dimorphism in Histoplasma spp., and global heating, additional work on understanding the complex relationship between Histoplasma and bats is desirable.The fungal genus Histoplasma causes lung, disseminated, gut and adrenal disease in humans, many with AIDS, but also people with normally functioning immune systems. Exposure and outbreaks are often linked to visiting caves where bats reside. In some locations, considerable quantities of Histoplasma fungus are found in bat guano and, when airborne, can cause infection. There are over 1400 species of bat worldwide. We reviewed the literature from 1962, the first recorded description of bat infection by Histoplasma, and found 49 different species of bat recorded as being infected. Most of the data are from the Americas, very little from Africa, and some from hyperendemic areas in SE Asia. Histoplasma are temperature sensitive fungi and bats, especially those which hibernate and use torpor to survive winter-time shortages of insect prey, occupy environments with a wide range of temperatures. Our understanding of bat infection or latency, in a world with extremes of weather and general heating, is likely to change the Histoplasma/bat relationship in uncertain ways.","2023-08-01","2024-11-25 21:37:36","2024-11-25 21:37:36","2024-11-25 21:37:36","myad080","","8","61","","Medical Mycology","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\PUN4VADW\Gugnani y Denning - 2023 - Infection of bats with Histoplasma species.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RHSHBYAH\7239297.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bats suffer from several threats caused by anthropization, including exposure to toxic metals and metalloids. We analyzed 75 papers in a systematic literature review to investigate how species, diet, and tissue type impact bioaccumulation. Most studies documented element accumulation in fur, liver, and kidney; at least 36 metals and metalloids have been measured in bat tissues, among the most studied were mercury and zinc. Comparisons with known toxicological thresholds for other mammals showed concerning values for mercury and zinc in bat hair, lead and some essential metals in liver, and iron and calcium in kidneys. Moreover, accumulation patterns in tissues differed depending on bat diet: insectivorous bats showed higher metal concentrations in fur than in liver and kidney while frugivorous species showed higher values in liver and kidney than in fur. Finally, among the bat species that have been studied in more than two papers, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) show values of mercury in hair and copper in liver that exceed the known thresholds; as does copper in the liver of the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus). Most studies have been conducted in temperate North America and Eurasia, areas with the lowest bat species diversity; there is a paucity of data on tropical bat species. This review points out several information gaps in the understanding of metal contamination in bats, including a lack of measured toxicity thresholds specific for bat tissues.

Reviewing the fidelity of 43 species of bats, I found that 25 frequently change roosts, 14 rarely change, and 4 show intraspecific variability in fidelity. A comparative analysis that controlled for phylogeny demonstrated that fidelity is related to the type of roost occupied: high fidelity is directly related to roost permanency and inversely related to roost availability. Lability may result from trade-offs between the benefits of fidelity (e.g., greater site familiarity, maintenance of social relationships, and retention of roosts particularly suited for raising offspring) versus those of lability (e.g., decreased commuting costs to foraging areas, familiarity with several roosts that differ in microclimate, lower probability of predator detection, and lower ectoparasite levels).","1995-05-19","2024-11-25 21:50:24","2024-11-25 21:50:24","2024-11-25 21:50:24","481-496","","2","76","","Journal of Mammalogy","Roost Fidelity of Bats","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although bats have a long history of association with rabies, the emergence and re-emergence of a number of viruses from bats that impact human and animal health has resulted in a resurgence of interest in bat immunology. Understanding how bats coexist with viruses in the absence of disease is essential if we are to begin to develop therapeutics to target viruses in humans and susceptible livestock and companion animals. Here, we review the current status of knowledge in the field of bat antiviral immunology including both adaptive and innate mechanisms of immune defence and highlight the need for further investigations in this area. Because data in this field are so limited, our discussion is based on both scientific discoveries and theoretical predictions. It is hoped that by provoking original, speculative or even controversial ideas or theories, this review may stimulate further research in this important field. Efforts to understand the immune systems of bats have been greatly facilitated in recent years by the availability of partial genome sequences from two species of bats, a megabat, Pteropus vampyrus, and a microbat, Myotis lucifugus, allowing the rapid identification of immune genes. Although bats appear to share most features of the immune system with other mammals, several studies have reported qualitative and quantitative differences in the immune responses of bats.

Nevertheless, human-caused environmental changes are jeopardizing bat communities, which results in the loss of functional roles provided by them. It is important, therefore, to assess ecological processes performed by bats in the Neotropics to define priorities in further research for better conservation planning. In this systematic review, I identify general trends, advances, bias, and knowledge gaps in bat-mediated ecological processes across Neotropical ecosystems. I have conducted an extensive search on Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and Bat Eco–Interactions Database resulting in 538 references, of which 185 papers were included in the review. The papers were published in 76 peer-reviewed journals, with the highest peak between 2006-2010. From the six biomes recorded, Moist broadleaf tropical forest was the most researched, contrary to Montane biomes (&gt;2000 m), where few studies have been conducted. Seed dispersal was the process with more studies (44%), followed by pollination (38%), nutrient cycling (10%), and arthropod suppression (8%). Seed dispersal and pollination displayed large bias on specific bat-plant systems (Artibeus-Ficus, Sturnira-Solanum, Carollia-Piper, Pachycereeae tribe-Leptonycteris) and ecoregions (Ithsmian-Atlantic moist forest, Cerrado, Tehuacán Valley matorral), thus being important to explore other bat and plant species as well as other ecosystems. Arthropod suppression and nutrient cycling were largely overlooked despite constituting essential functions in ecosystem resilience; particularly, more research is needed to know cascading effects on plant fitness in different agroforestry systems, but also is key the understanding of how bats can be pivotal mobile links in terrestrial ecosystems and cave environments. I highlight the importance to consider bats with multiple roles and functional trait-based approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of their functionality. Even though functional studies have increased in the last two decades, several aspects of bat roles are still obscured, and is necessary to keep evaluating their ecological and economic importance to provide useful information for major decision-makings in Neotropical ecosystems’ conservation. Bat extirpations are likely to affect their ecological roles, therefore, mitigating major threats of bats are urgently needed to sustain ecosystem integrity in the Neotropics.","2020-08-19","2024-11-25 21:53:03","2024-11-25 21:53:03","2024-11-25 21:53:03","77-101","","1","6","","","Why bats matters","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2020 Dennis Castillo-Figueroa","","","","journals.ku.edu","","Number: 1","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\LNL9LUGQ\Castillo-Figueroa - 2020 - Why bats matters A critical assessment of bat-mediated ecological processes in the Neotropics.pdf","","","Chiroptera; Ecosystems; Pollination; Arthropod suppression; Functional roles; Functional trait; Neotropical Region; New World Bats.; Nutrient cycling; Seed dispersal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we test the hypothesis that a bat species foraging on flying insects like moths will show ample flexibility in trophic niche, and this irrespective of phylogenetic relationships among moths, so as to cope with a high diversity of prey types that vary across seasons. We predict that individual bats will show functional dietary differences consistent with energetic requirements and hunting skills. We used DNA metabarcoding to determine the diet of 126 Mediterranean horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus euryale) from two different sites during three seasons. Simultaneously, we measured moth availability and characterized the traits of 290 moth taxa. Next, we explored the relationship between phylogeny and traits of all consumed and available moth taxa. Finally, we assessed the relationship between individual traits of bats and traits related to prey profitability, for which we used the RLQ and fourth-corner statistical techniques. Seasonality was the main factor explaining the functional dietary variation in adult bats, with moths consumed irrespective of their phylogenetic relationships. While adults consumed moths with a broad range in wing loading, body mass and echolocation detection ability, juveniles consumed slower, smaller and lighter moths, which suggests that young individuals may undergo some fitness gain and/or psychomotor learning process during which they would acquire more effective foraging skills. Our approach revealed a degree of functional flexibility in the trophic niche previously unknown for an insectivorous bat. Rhinolophus euryale consumed a wide variety of moth taxa differing in profitability throughout seasons and between ontogenetic stages. We showed the validity of trait-based approaches to gain new insights in the trophic specialization of predators consuming hundreds of species of prey.","2019","2024-11-25 21:55:16","2024-11-25 21:55:16","2024-11-25 21:55:16","1587-1600","","10","88","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

However, structures like the pollex have not been assessed yet. Here, I describe pollex measurements of 97 Neotropical bat species, analyze variation among guilds, and explore correlations with wing morphology. Besides sanguinivores, frugivores that use cluttered habitats and employ gleaning strategy showed larger pollex, whereas aerial insectivores that use open spaces presented smaller pollex. I found a negative relationship between pollex size and hand-wing length, but a positive relationship between pollex size and wing width. Results suggest a potential importance of the pollex on resource exploitation, especially in guilds associated to handling objects such as large fruits. Conversely, the pollex may be useless in aerial insectivores that employ other structures like uropatagium or dactylopatagium for prey capture and manipulation. The pollex is related to wing morphology and habitat use given that species with larger pollex and wide wings obtain their resources in cluttered habitats, while species with shorter pollex and longer wings acquire their preys over open spaces. It is important to keep documenting natural history of bats by studying unexplored structures that unveil the functional importance of morphology in resource exploitation.","2022","2024-10-10 16:28:40","2025-01-08 21:28:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\LYMM86RY\Castillo-Figueroa - 2022 - Exploring a Hidden Structure in New World Bats The Pollex.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\WPE5HEWP\Castillo-Figueroa - 2022 - Exploring a Hidden Structure in New World Bats The Pollex.pdf","","","natural history","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, urbanisation leads to the loss of habitats, species, and functional groups. Understanding how multiple taxa respond to urbanisation globally is essential to promote and conserve biodiversity in cities. Using a dataset encompassing six terrestrial faunal taxa (amphibians, bats, bees, birds, carabid beetles and reptiles) across 379 cities on 6 continents, we show that urbanisation produces taxon-specific changes in trait composition, with traits related to reproductive strategy showing the strongest response. Our findings suggest that urbanisation results in four trait syndromes (mobile generalists, site specialists, central place foragers, and mobile specialists), with resources associated with reproduction and diet likely driving patterns in traits associated with mobility and body size. Functional diversity measures showed varied responses, leading to shifts in trait space likely driven by critical resource distribution and abundance, and taxon-specific trait syndromes. Maximising opportunities to support taxa with different urban trait syndromes should be pivotal in conservation and management programmes within and among cities. This will reduce the likelihood of biotic homogenisation and helps ensure that urban environments have the capacity to respond to future challenges. These actions are critical to reframe the role of cities in global biodiversity loss.","2023-08-07","2024-11-25 21:59:02","2024-11-25 21:59:15","2024-11-25 21:59:02","4751","","1","14","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\B9F3Q9HD\Hahs et al. - 2023 - Urbanisation generates multiple trait syndromes for terrestrial animal taxa worldwide.pdf","","To Read","Biodiversity; Macroecology; Urban ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of polytocy in chiropterans and use phylogenetically informed regressions to investigate its relationship to roost type, longevity and group size. Our phylogenetic reconstructions suggested that production of multiple offspring was the ancestral condition in family Vespertilionidae. The distribution of monotocy/polytocy in Chiroptera was best explained by a minimum of two evolutionary transitions from monotocy to polytocy and by ≥ 18 transitions from polytocy to monotocy. The regression models showed that longevity and roost type explained the variation in litter size, whereas group size did not. Our analyses also revealed a greater diversity of polytocous bats in the Northern Hemisphere, in both temperate and tropical regions. We suggest that the high resource allocation to reproduction in polytocous bats limited their lifespan. The absence of a relationship between polytocy and group size indicates that the benefits of cooperative breeding surpass the costs of intrasexual competition in bats.","2021-03-01","2024-11-25 22:00:46","2024-11-25 22:01:12","2024-11-25 22:00:46","676-684","","3","132","","Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\VU94H5PI\Garbino et al. - 2021 - Evolution of litter size in bats and its influence on longevity and roosting ecology.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\JFML7LSL\6090169.html","","To Read","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the global research trends in terms of annual publications, active journals, authors, institutions, and countries. We identified growth trends in the past 50 years, to which the United States was found to be the largest contributor. The University of Bristol, the University of Munich, and the Smithsonian Institute were the representative institutions of publication records. Meanwhile, Acta Chiropterologica, Journal of Experimental Biology, and Journal of the Acoustical Society of America were the top three active platforms for bat echolocation research. Co-occurrence analysis of keywords identified five clusters that correspond to five major research topics in bat echolocation: “habitat use and conservation,” “evolution,” “physiology and nervous system,” “communication and social call,” and “hunting and predation.” The overlay visualization indicated that studies on the evolution of bat echolocation had become the latest research trend, which we summarized and reviewed.

The Chiroptera Specialist Group of IUCN's Species Survival Commission has produced two Action Plans examining conservation issues for all species and detailing recommendations for action to conserve the most threatened species and habitats. These Plans are aimed principally at key decision makers as well as organisations and individuals who are promoting bat conservation issues. The underlying threat to bats is pressure on resources from increasing human populations that leads to the loss or modification of foraging habitats and roosts. Bats frequently have a negative public image that influences the response to the problems of rabies and vampire bats in Latin America and conflicts between bats and commercial fruit growers in other areas of the world. In some areas bats are persecuted because people are ignorant of the life history of bats and their role in ecosystems, while in other areas bats are overexploited for food. There is also a general lack of information about the distribution, status, biology and ecology of many species. This review examines some of the more general issues relating to bat conservation. It provides information on bat faunas of all countries worldwide, and on the most threatened species. It highlights the priority areas where action is needed immediately at a global, regional or national level.

Considering the accessibility and increase in use of tracking devices in wildlife studies, it is important to better understand the effects on these on animals. Our endeavour revisits a guideline established in 1988, which proposes that bats may encounter body condition or health problems and alter their behaviour when carrying tags weighing more than 5% of their body mass. Through a systematic literature review, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify the impacts of tags on bats, including 367 papers from 1976 to 2023 that discussed, mentioned, employed, or quantified tagging of bats. We noted that the proportion of studies exceeding the 5% rule has not changed in recent years. However, the impact of tags was quantified in few studies for behaviour (n = 7) and body condition (n = 10) of bats. We were unable to assess whether tags weighing less or more than 5% of the bat's body mass impacted bats, but our meta-analysis did identify that tags, irrespective of mass, affect the behaviour and body condition of bats. Although the overall magnitude of measured effects of tags on bats was small, progress has been made to advance our understanding of tag mass on bats. Naturally, there is a bias in reporting of significant results, illustrating the need of reporting results when there is no apparent effect of tags on bats. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous reporting of behaviour and body condition data associated with tagging of animals and illustrate the importance for studies comparing how tracking devices of different dimensions and masses may impact bat species to ensure research meets rigorous ethical standards.","2024","2024-11-26 21:14:31","2025-01-08 21:56:30","2024-11-26 21:14:31","","","n/a","n/a","","","Re-weighing the 5% tagging recommendation","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Author(s).

We collected survival estimates for 44 microbat species from the literature and constructed a model to determine the effects of reproductive, feeding and demographic traits on survival. Our trait-based model indicated that bat species which produce more young per year exhibit lower apparent annual survival, as do males and juveniles compared with females and adults, respectively. Using 8 years of monitoring data for two Australian species, we demonstrate how knowledge about the effect of traits on survival can be incorporated into Bayesian survival analyses.

We carried out a meta-analysis of the published literature to review the history of the use of SDMs in bat research and their application in conservation, climate change assessments and genetic studies. We focus on the geographical coverage, theme and modelling algorithm of published studies, and compare studies that are uniquely dedicated to bats to multi-taxa studies that include bats. We provide recommendations for good modelling practices through considering spatial scale and spatial biases, selecting ecologically relevant variables, following rigorous modelling protocols, and recognising the limitations of extrapolation across temporal scales. We suggest future developments that will further favour the use of SDMs to study bat ecology and biogeography, as well as inform conservation management. We conclude that despite an increase in bat SDM studies, their scope and application can be further enhanced through incorporating dispersal, landscape connectivity and biotic interactions between bats, their prey and their pathogens.","2016-06-16","2024-11-27 20:30:47","2025-01-08 21:30:44","2024-11-27 20:31:14","","","1","27","","","Painting maps with bats","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (CSL JSON)","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RDZBEKY5\Razgour et al. - 2016 - Painting maps with bats species distribution modelling in bat research and conservation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, renewable energy facilities may adversely affect wildlife. Facility siting guidelines recommend or require project developers complete pre- and postconstruction wildlife surveys to predict risk and estimate effects of proposed projects. Despite this, there are no published studies that have quantified the types of surveys used or how survey types are standardized within and across facilities. We evaluated 628 peer-reviewed publications, unpublished reports, and citations, and we analyzed data from 525 of these sources (203 facilities: 193 wind and 10 solar) in the United States and Canada to determine the frequency of pre- and postconstruction surveys and whether that frequency changed over time; frequency of studies explicitly designed to allow before-after or impact-control analyses; and what types of survey data were collected during pre- and postconstruction periods and how those data types were standardized across periods and among facilities. Within our data set, postconstruction monitoring for wildlife fatalities and habitat use was a standard practice (n = 446 reports), but preconstruction estimation of baseline wildlife habitat use and mortality was less frequently reported (n = 84). Only 22% (n = 45) of the 203 facilities provided data from both pre- and postconstruction, and 29% (n = 59) had experimental study designs. Of 108 facilities at which habitat-use surveys were conducted, only 3% estimated of detection probability. Thus, the available data generally preclude comparison of biological data across construction periods and among facilities. Use of experimental study designs and following similar field protocols would improve the knowledge of how renewable energy affects wildlife.

To provide a current summary of known impacts to birds and bats in Latin America and to identify gaps on this important information, we compiled, reviewed, and synthesized bird and bat fatality information at wind energy projects in the region. Our literature search resulted in 10 references relevant to the scope of this review, six of which provided number of fatalities by species and the type of PCFM search being conducted, meeting our criteria for inclusion in fatality summaries. From this pool, we found that Passerines composed the majority of bird fatalities, with no Threatened bird species reported. The bat family Molossidae composed the majority of bat fatalities, with one Threatened bat species reported. Our review of all studies and focused assessment of only those studies with fatality summaries indicated differences in the amount of information and level of detail related to bird and bat fatalities at wind energy projects in Latin America. Due to the taxon-specific nature of collision risk with wind turbines for birds and bats, it is difficult to make a general impact assessment of wind energy development on birds and bats in Latin America, especially given the limited information available. However, this summary can be used as a starting point to inform conservation efforts aiming at avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating impacts of wind energy development on birds and bats and future, standardized results would enhance our ability to do so.","2021-06","2024-11-27 21:35:12","2024-11-27 21:35:12","","e07251","","6","7","","Heliyon","Post-construction bird and bat fatality monitoring studies at wind energy projects in Latin America","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34189305 PMCID: PMC8215218","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Y3GKZIB3\Agudelo et al. - 2021 - Post-construction bird and bat fatality monitoring studies at wind energy projects in Latin America.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189305","","Threatened species; Renewable energy; Direct impacts; Fatality summaries; Latin America and the caribbean; Wind-wildlife interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While there is a growing concern of increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) globally during this pandemic, knowledge of AMR circulating between bats and humans is limited. In this paper, we have reviewed the evidence of AMR in bats and discussed the planetary health aspect of AMR to elucidate how this is associated with the emergence, spread, and persistence of AMR at the human–animal interface. The presence of clinically significant resistant bacteria in bats and wildlife has important implications for zoonotic pandemic surveillance, disease transmission, and treatment modalities. We searched MEDLINE through PubMed and Google Scholar to retrieve relevant studies (n = 38) that provided data on resistant bacteria in bats prior to 30 September 2022. There is substantial variability in the results from studies measuring the prevalence of AMR based on geographic location, bat types, and time. We found all major groups of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in bats, which are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. The most alarming issue is that recent studies have increasingly identified clinically significant multi-drug resistant bacteria such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ESBL producing, and Colistin resistant Enterobacterales in samples from bats. This evidence of superbugs abundant in both humans and wild mammals, such as bats, could facilitate a greater understanding of which specific pathways of exposure should be targeted. We believe that these data will also facilitate future pandemic preparedness as well as global AMR containment during pandemic events and beyond.","2023-01","2024-11-27 21:46:50","2024-11-27 21:46:50","2024-11-27 21:46:51","243","","1","20","","","Evidence of Antimicrobial Resistance in Bats and Its Planetary Health Impact for Surveillance of Zoonotic Spillover Events","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\E47UJL9T\Devnath et al. - 2023 - Evidence of Antimicrobial Resistance in Bats and Its Planetary Health Impact for Surveillance of Zoo.pdf","","","bats; antimicrobial resistance (AMR); one health; planetary health; zoonotic spillover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As anthropogenic change alters the distribution of this species, shifts in predator–prey interactions are expected. Understanding prey richness and patterns of prey selection is, thus, increasingly informative from ecological, epidemiological, and economic perspectives. We reviewed D. rotundus diet and assessed the geographical, taxonomical, and behavioral features to find 63 vertebrate species within 21 orders and 45 families constitute prey, including suitable host species in regions of invasion outside D. rotundus’ range. Rodentia contained the largest number of species utilized by D. rotundus, though cattle were the most commonly reported prey source, likely linked to the high availability of livestock and visibility of bite wounds compared to wildlife. Additionally, there was tendency to predate upon species with diurnal activity and social behavior, potentially facilitating convenient and nocturnal predation. Our review highlights the dietary heterogeneity of D. rotundus across its distribution. We define D. rotundus as a generalist predator, or parasite, depending on the ecological definition of its symbiont roles in an ecosystem (i.e., lethal vs. non-lethal blood consumption). In view of the eminent role of D. rotundus in rabies virus transmission and its range expansion, an understanding of its ecology would benefit public health, wildlife management, and agriculture.","2023-08","2025-01-08 21:40:41","2025-01-08 21:40:42","2025-01-08 21:40:41","433-453","","4","103","","Mamm Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\VRJQJRLV\Brown y Escobar - 2023 - A review of the diet of the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) in the context of anthropogenic c.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anticoagulants-based control methods for the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) have been employed continuously since the 1970s with various methods of application, presentations, doses and active ingredients. Studies from half a century ago still serve as a reference for the current use of anticoagulants for bat-borne rabies control in Latin America. The objective of this study was to structurally and bibliometrically review literature on the use of anticoagulants for the control of D. rotundus as a means of rabies control. Materials & Methods Scientific literature on the use of anticoagulant products for D. rotundus control was obtained, reviewed and analysed. Articles were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Research articles from 1971 to 2021 in Spanish, English and Portuguese were included in the review. Results were visualised using RStudio, Bibliometrix and VOSviewer. Results The body of literature indicates effectiveness of up to 100% in the use of anticoagulants to induce bat mortality. The effectiveness of anticoagulants for rabies control, however, remains uncertain. No evidence was found to support or refute the use of anticoagulants for rabies control. Discussion Instead, literature suggests that disturbing bat colonies increases rabies prevalence. This finding suggests that anticoagulants may have the opposite intended effect on rabies control and highlights the importance of further research on the practical methods for bat-borne rabies prevention. Conclusion Field experimental studies that include control groups over areas and periods that account for D. rotundus ecology are needed to determine the effectiveness of anticoagulants for rabies control in livestock. In conclusion, the use of anticoagulants for rabies control is questionable.","2024","2025-01-07 16:28:51","2025-01-08 21:56:08","2025-01-08 21:42:28","","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Author(s).

Most studies into the collision risk between species and wind turbines, however, have taken place in industrialized countries. Potential effects for many locations and species therefore remain unclear. To redress this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of recorded collisions between birds and bats and wind turbines within developed countries. We related collision rate to species-level traits and turbine characteristics to quantify the potential vulnerability of 9538 bird and 888 bat species globally. Avian collision rate was affected by migratory strategy, dispersal distance and habitat associations, and bat collision rates were influenced by dispersal distance. For birds and bats, larger turbine capacity (megawatts) increased collision rates; however, deploying a smaller number of large turbines with greater energy output reduced total collision risk per unit energy output, although bat mortality increased again with the largest turbines. Areas with high concentrations of vulnerable species were also identified, including migration corridors. Our results can therefore guide wind farm design and location to reduce the risk of large-scale animal mortality. This is the first quantitative global assessment of the relative collision vulnerability of species groups with wind turbines, providing valuable guidance for minimizing potentially serious negative impacts on biodiversity.","2017-09-13","2025-01-08 21:54:38","2025-01-08 21:54:38","2025-01-08 21:54:38","20170829","","1862","284","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\I7CX26E7\Thaxter et al. - 2017 - Bird and bat species' global vulnerability to collision mortality at wind farms revealed through a t.pdf","","","biodiversity; climate change; impact; meta-analysis; phylogeny; renewable energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
