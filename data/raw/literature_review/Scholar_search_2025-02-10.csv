The development and growth of global species’ trait databases are critical for improving trait-based analyses; however, it is vital to understand the gaps and biases in the available data. We reviewed bat wing morphology data, specifically mass, wingspan, wing area, wing loading, and aspect ratio, to identify issues with data reporting and ambiguity. Additionally, we aimed to assess taxonomic and geographic biases in trait data coverage. We found that most studies used similar field methodology, but that data reporting and quality were inconsistent/poor. Additionally, we noted several issues regarding semantic ambiguity in trait definitions, specifically around what constitutes wing area. Globally, we found that bat wing morphology trait coverage was low. Only six bat families had ≥40% trait coverage, and, of those, none consisted of more than 11 species in total. We found similar biases in trait coverage across International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categories, with threatened species having lower coverage. Geographically, North America, Europe, and the Indomalayan regions exhibited higher overall trait coverage, while both the Afrotropical and Neotropical ecoregions showed poor trait coverage. The underlying biases and gaps in bat wing morphology data have implications for researchers conducting global trait-based assessments. Implementing imputation techniques may address missing data, but only for smaller regional subsets with substantial trait coverage. Due to generally low overall trait coverage, increasing species’ representation in the database should be prioritised. We suggest adopting an Ecological Trait Standard Vocabulary to reduce semantic ambiguity in bat wing morphology traits, to improve data compilation and clarity. Additionally, we advocate that researchers adopt an Open Science approach to facilitate the growth of a bat wing morphology trait database.","2022","2025-02-10 20:38:14","2025-02-10 20:38:14","2025-02-10 20:38:14","165-176","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12270","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\FYYK633D\Crane et al. - 2022 - Limitations and gaps in global bat wing morphology trait data.pdf","","","aspect ratio; bats (Chiroptera); reproducibility; spatial biases; species’ traits; taxonomic biases; wing loading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using temperate bats, a group of particular conservation concern, we investigated how morphological traits, habitat specialization and environmental variables affect home range sizes and daily foraging movements, using a compilation of 30 years of published bat telemetry data. Location Northern America and Europe. Time period 1988–2016. Major taxa studied Bats. Methods We compiled data on home range size and mean daily distance between roosts and foraging areas at both colony and individual levels from 166 studies of 3,129 radiotracked individuals of 49 bat species. We calculated multi-scale habitat composition and configuration in the surrounding landscapes of the 165 studied roosts. Using mixed models, we examined the effects of habitat availability and spatial arrangement on bat movements, while accounting for body mass, aspect ratio, wing loading and habitat specialization. Results We found a significant effect of landscape composition on home range size and mean daily distance at both colony and individual levels. On average, home ranges were up to 42% smaller in the most habitat-diversified landscapes while mean daily distances were up to 30% shorter in the most forested landscapes. Bat home range size significantly increased with body mass, wing aspect ratio and wing loading, and decreased with habitat specialization. Main conclusions Promoting bat movements through the landscape surrounding roosts at large spatial scales is crucial for bat conservation. Forest loss and overall landscape homogenization lead temperate bats to fly further to meet their ecological requirements, by increasing home range sizes and daily foraging distances. Both processes might be more detrimental for smaller, habitat-specialized bats, less able to travel increasingly longer distances to meet their diverse needs.","2021","2025-02-10 20:38:23","2025-02-10 20:38:23","2025-02-10 20:38:23","2442-2454","","12","30","","","Landscape composition and life-history traits influence bat movement and space use","","","","","","","en","© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.13397","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\MSKL9B6R\Laforge et al. - 2021 - Landscape composition and life-history traits influence bat movement and space use Analysis of 30 y.pdf","","","mammals; Chiroptera; home range; minimum convex polygon; animal movement; central place forager; landscape complementation; radiotracking; spatial behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brock","Bat Ecology","","978-0-226-46207-3","","","","In recent years researchers have discovered that bats play key roles in many ecosystems as insect predators, seed dispersers, and pollinators. Bats also display astonishing ecological and evolutionary diversity and serve as important models for studies of a wide variety of topics, including food webs, biogeography, and emerging diseases. In Bat Ecology, world-renowned bat scholars present an up-to-date, comprehensive, and authoritative review of this ongoing research.  The first part of the book covers the life history and behavioral ecology of bats, from migration to sperm competition and natural selection. The next section focuses on functional ecology, including ecomorphology, feeding, and physiology. In the third section, contributors explore macroecological issues such as the evolution of ecological diversity, range size, and infectious diseases (including rabies) in bats. A final chapter discusses conservation challenges facing these fascinating flying mammals.  Bat Ecology is the most comprehensive state-of-the-field collection for scientists and researchers.

However, current urban ecology research has focused mostly on urban birds and plants, limiting our ability to make generalizations about the drivers of urban biodiversity globally. To address this gap, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 87 studies, including 180 bat species (Chiroptera) from urban areas in Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. We aimed to (i) understand the importance of functional traits and phylogeny in driving changes in urban bat assemblages, and (ii) assess the capacity of traits for predicting which types of species are most sensitive to urbanization. Our results indicate that species-specific functional traits explain differences in the intensity of urban habitat use. Urban tolerance mainly occurred within the open and edge space foraging and trawling species as well as in bats with flexible roosting strategies. In addition, across bioregions and independent of phylogeny, urban tolerance correlated with higher aspect ratio, a trait enabling fast flight but less agile manoeuvres during aerial food acquisition. Predictive success varied between bioregions, between 43 and 83%. Our analysis demonstrates that the local extinction of bat species in urban areas is non-random, trait-based and predictable, allowing urban landscape managers to tailor local conservation actions to particular types of species.","2018-08-22","2025-02-10 20:39:06","2025-02-10 20:39:06","2025-02-10 20:39:06","20181222","","1885","285","","","Trait-dependent tolerance of bats to urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\4IQSCWS5\Jung y Threlfall - 2018 - Trait-dependent tolerance of bats to urbanization a global meta-analysis.pdf","","","conservation; biodiversity; functional traits; Chiroptera; meta-analysis; urban ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, trait-based approaches have been used in several taxa to better understand mechanisms underlying species assemblages, biotic interactions, environmental relationships and ecosystem functions. However, despite the relevance of bats on ecosystem dynamics, so far, there is no conceptual framework that relies on the measurement of bat traits to address functional studies. Here, we present a set of 50 bat biological traits, which are suitable to assess environmental stressors and can potentially affect ecological processes. Several examples were provided to show the applicability of this framework in the study of Neotropical bat ecology. We suggest some considerations regarding trait-based approach including the importance of intraspecific variation, correlations between traits, response-effect framework, global dataset, and future directions to assess the reliability of functional relations across species and Neotropical regions by using traits. This could be helpful in tackling ecological questions associated with community assembly and habitat filtering, species diversity patterns along environmental gradients, and ecological processes. We envision this paper as a first step toward an integrative bat functional trait protocol held up with solid evidence.Keywords: Chiroptera; Ecosystem functions; Functional traits; Morphology; Life-history","2021-04-16","2025-02-10 20:39:22","2025-02-10 20:39:22","2025-02-10 20:39:22","e20216124","","","61","","Pap.

Yet relatively few mechanistic studies have focused on this longevity. On average, species of Chiroptera live three times longer than predicted by their body size. In addition, bats have other life history traits that are characteristic of large, long-lived mammals such as few and large offspring and slow growth rates. Bats fit the evolutionary theory of ageing, as their extended longevity is predicted by their ability to escape extrinsic mortality through flight and, in some species, hibernation. They also show tradeoffs between longevity and reproduction, as predicted by the disposable soma theory of ageing. From a physiological perspective, bat longevity reportedly correlates with replicative longevity, low brain calpain activity, and reduced reactive oxygen species production.

Three of the four also have long canine teeth relative to their maxillary toothrows. Carnivorous bats have more elongate skulls, larger brain volumes and larger pinnae. The wide-faced bats are all dral emitters and have heads positively tilted relative to the basicranial axis. The carnivorous species are nasal-emitting bats and have negatively tilted heads. The orientation of the head relative to the basicranial axis affects several characters of the skull and jaws and is not correlated with size.

Bivariate correlations are presented between wing dimensions and body mass for a range of bat families and feeding classes, and principal-components analysis is used to measure overall size, wing size and wing shape. The principal components representing wing size and wing shape (as opposed to overall size) are interpreted as being equivalent to wing loading and to aspect ratio. Relative length and area of the hand-wing or wingtip are determined independently of wing size, and are used to derive a wingtip shape index, which measures the degree of roundedness or pointedness of the wingtip. The optimal wing form for bats adapted for different modes of flight is predicted by means of mechanical and aerodynamic models. We identify and model aspects of performance likely to influence flight adaptation significantly; these include selective pressures for economic forward flight (low energy per unit time or per unit distance (equal to cost of transport)), for flight at high or low speeds, for hovering, and for turning. ""Turning performance is measured by two quantities: manoeuvrability, referring to the minimum space required for a turn at a given speed; and agility, relating to the rate at which a turn can be initiated. High flight speed correlates with high wing loading, good manoeuvrability is favoured by low wing loading, and turning agility should be associated with fast flight and with high wing loading. Other factors influencing wing adaptations, such as migration, flying with a foetus or young or carrying loads in flight (all of which favour large wing area), flight in cluttered environments (short wings) and modes of landing, are identified. The mechanical predictions are cast into a size-independent principal-components form, and are related to the morphology and the observed flight behaviour of different species and families of bats. In this way we provide a broadly based functional interpretation of the selective forces that influence wing morphology in bats. Measured flight speeds in bats permit testing of these predictions. Comparison of open-field free-flight speeds with morphology confirms that speed correlates with mass, wing loading and wingtip proportions as expected; there is no direct relation between speed and aspect ratio. Some adaptive trends in bat wing morphology are clear from this analysis. Insectivores hunt in a range of different ways, which are reflected in their morphology. Bats hawking high-flying insects have small, pointed wings which give good agility, high flight speeds and low cost of transport. Bats hunting for insects among vegetation, and perhaps gleaning, have very short and rounded wingtips, and often relatively short, broad wings, giving good manoeuvrability at low flight speeds. Many insectivorous species forage by ‘ flycatching ’ (perching while seeking prey) and have somewhat similar morphology to gleaners. Insectivorous species foraging in more open habitats usually have slightly longer wings, and hence lower cost of transport. Piscivores forage over open stretches of water, and have very long wings giving low flight power and cost of transport, and unusually long, rounded tips for control and stability in flight. Carnivores must carry heavy loads, and thus have relatively large wing areas; their foraging strategies consist of perching, hunting and gleaning, and wing structure is similar to that of insectivorous species with similar behaviour. Perching and hovering nectarivores both have a relatively small wing area: this surprising result may result from environmental pressure for a short wingspan or from the advantage of high speed during commuting flights; the large wingtips of these bats are valuable for lift generation in slow flight. The relation between flight morphology (as an indicator of flight behaviour) and echolocation is considered. It is demonstrated that adaptive trends in wing adaptations are predictably and closely paralleled by echolocation call structure, owing to the joint constraints of flying and locating food in different ways. Pressures on flight morphology depend also on size, with most aspects of performance favouring smaller animals. Power rises rapidly as mass increases; in smaller bats the available energy margin is greater than in larger species, and they may have a more generalized repertoire of flight behaviour. Trophic pressures related to feeding strategy and behaviour are also important, and may restrict the size ranges of different feeding classes: insectivores and primary nectarivores must be relatively small, carnivores and frugivores somewhat larger. The relation of these results to bat community ecology is considered, as our predictions may be tested through comparisons between comparable, sympatric species. Our mechanical predictions apply to all bats and to all kinds of bat communities, but other factors (for example echolocation) may also contribute to specialization in feeding or behaviour, and species separation may not be determined solely by wing morphology or flight behaviour. None the less, we believe that our approach, of identifying functional correlates of bat flight behaviour and identifying these with morphological adaptations, clarifies the eco-morphological relationships of bats.","1997-01","2025-02-10 20:39:55","2025-02-10 20:39:55","2025-02-10 20:39:55","335-427","","1179","316","","","Ecological morphology and flight in bats (Mammalia; Chiroptera)","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\WLRJNP6X\Norberg et al. - 1997 - Ecological morphology and flight in bats (Mammalia; Chiroptera) wing adaptations, flight performanc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review the role of ecological and evolutionary processes operating across different hierarchically spatial scales to shape diversity patterns of bats—the second largest mammal order and the only mammals with real flight capability.","2018-06-11","2025-02-10 20:40:12","2025-02-10 20:40:12","2025-02-10 20:40:12","18","","1","18","","BMC Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\YCCTG2WJ\Peixoto et al. - 2018 - A synthesis of ecological and evolutionary determinants of bat diversity across spatial scales.pdf","","","Chiroptera; Evolutionary history; Communities; Diversity gradients; Guild; Scale hierarchy; Spatial scales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the functional diversity and functional trait filtering of aerial insectivorous bats in both insular forest patches created by a vast 30-year-old hydropower reservoir and the adjacent mainland continuous forest in Central Amazonia. Bats were surveyed using passive bat recorders across 34 forest sites. Based on a set of morphological traits derived for each species recorded, we estimated both the bat functional richness, functional evenness and functional dispersion at each surveyed site. We further assessed the effects of local vegetation, patch and landscape features on patterns of functional diversity. The interaction between functional traits, environmental characteristics, and species distribution was investigated using a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. We found that mainland sites retained higher functional richness and lower functional evenness compared to forest islands, indicating a more complete functional assemblage in the mainland. Additionally, species composition was affected by local vegetation structure and forest area, with small isolated islands exhibiting pervasive loss of functional traits. RLQ and fourth-corner analyses showed that larger understorey foraging species with greater dispersal capacity, constant frequency–frequency modulated calls, and higher frequency of maximum energy were associated with more isolated small islands. Conversely, forest subcanopy species, exhibiting quasi-constant frequency calls and presenting low dispersal capacity were associated with continuous forests and islands with greater forest area, and were therefore more sensitive to habitat insularization. Our study calls attention to the pervasive impacts induced by large dams on the functional diversity of tropical insectivorous bats. We recommend that future assessments of the effects of habitat fragmentation on mammals should include traits linked to ecosystem services. In designing and licensing new dams, we suggest the creation of extensive protected areas surrounding mainland forests to minimize the detrimental impacts of small isolated islands and safeguard the full complement of key ecological functions provided by insectivorous bats.

Bats are essential components of ecosystems and are useful bio-indicators of habitat disturbance, yet the response and vulnerability of bats to fragmentation have been poorly studied in Africa. We aim to assess the effects of forest biogeographical history and fragmentation on functional diversity of bats and their functional traits. Location Eastern Cape and southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Taxon Insectivorous bats. Methods We surveyed forest-utilizing bats to derive four functional diversity indices. Generalized linear models were used to assess the response of diversity indices to biogeographical history and fragmentation, represented by forest type and five landscape fragmentation metrics. RLQ and fourth-corner analysis were used to investigate the interaction of traits with fragmentation metrics and forest type. Results Pondoland Scarp forests displayed high functional richness, while Eastern Cape Dune forests exhibited high functional divergence yet low functional richness and dispersion. Two fragmentation metrics affected functional diversity dynamically: edge density had a positive effect on functional evenness; and dispersion was negatively affected by river length through forests. Results showed stronger interactions of functional traits with forest type than fragmentation metrics, with filtering effects on body size and wing morphology. Main conclusions The large-scale processes related to biogeographical history, and associated forest structure, are important determinants of functional richness, divergence and dispersion of insectivorous bat communities. Scarp forests showed the highest species and functional richness as they experienced less extreme climatic extinction filtering than Mistbelt forests during the Last Glacial Maximum, whereas the low diversity of Eastern Cape Dune forests results from their younger evolutionary history and homogenous vegetation structure. Little is known of the sensitivity of bats to habitat fragmentation in Africa: here, we show larger-sized insectivorous species; and species exhibiting low wing loading may be more vulnerable to fragmentation.","2021","2025-02-10 20:41:19","2025-02-10 20:41:19","2025-02-10 20:41:19","1170-1182","","5","48","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jbi.14069","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\8PWUC3DE\Moir et al. - 2021 - Functional diversity and trait filtering of insectivorous bats relate to forest biogeography and fra.pdf","","","Chiroptera; Bioacoustics; RLQ and fourth-corner analyses; clutter-edge guild; edge effects; past climate change; trait–environment relationships","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, the available species pool is determined in part by historical adaptation to the native ecosystem, but the resulting community structure may be determined principally by the ability of evolved traits to function in the novel context of a human-dominated ecosystem. To investigate the role of human disturbance as a determinant of bat communities, we surveyed assemblages and species occurrence rates in 27 agriculturally dominated landscapes exhibiting a gradient of human-induced forest fragmentation in Indiana, USA. We used multiple linear regression to explore the relationship of landscape environmental variables to species diversity. We then examined the relationship between community structure, evolved species traits and fragmentation conditions across a landscape using RLQ analysis. Overall, species diversity was positively related to the amount of forest and negatively correlated with amount of urban development in a landscape. We also observed a significant relationship between evolved species traits and landscape-level variables that is consistent with globally anticipated trends for bat species extinction risk.

Here, we test the hypothesis that a bat species foraging on flying insects like moths will show ample flexibility in trophic niche, and this irrespective of phylogenetic relationships among moths, so as to cope with a high diversity of prey types that vary across seasons. We predict that individual bats will show functional dietary differences consistent with energetic requirements and hunting skills. We used DNA metabarcoding to determine the diet of 126 Mediterranean horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus euryale) from two different sites during three seasons. Simultaneously, we measured moth availability and characterized the traits of 290 moth taxa. Next, we explored the relationship between phylogeny and traits of all consumed and available moth taxa. Finally, we assessed the relationship between individual traits of bats and traits related to prey profitability, for which we used the RLQ and fourth-corner statistical techniques. Seasonality was the main factor explaining the functional dietary variation in adult bats, with moths consumed irrespective of their phylogenetic relationships. While adults consumed moths with a broad range in wing loading, body mass and echolocation detection ability, juveniles consumed slower, smaller and lighter moths, which suggests that young individuals may undergo some fitness gain and/or psychomotor learning process during which they would acquire more effective foraging skills. Our approach revealed a degree of functional flexibility in the trophic niche previously unknown for an insectivorous bat. Rhinolophus euryale consumed a wide variety of moth taxa differing in profitability throughout seasons and between ontogenetic stages. We showed the validity of trait-based approaches to gain new insights in the trophic specialization of predators consuming hundreds of species of prey.","2019","2025-02-10 20:45:50","2025-02-10 20:45:50","2025-02-10 20:45:50","1587-1600","","10","88","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

In the absence of direct fossil evidence there have been many speculative scenarios advanced to explain the evolution of these behaviours and their distributions in extant bats. Theories assuming chiropteran monophyly have generally presumed the ancestral pre-bat was nocturnal, arboreal and insectivorous. Following this assumption hypotheses can be divided into the echolocation first, flight first and tandem development hypotheses, all of which assume that flight evolved only once in the lineage. In contrast, the chiropteran diphyly hypothesis suggests that flight evolved twice. Evidence supporting and refuting the different hypotheses are reviewed. It is concluded that there are significant problems attached to all the current models. A novel hypothesis is advanced, which starts from the assumption that bats are monophyletic and the ancestral pre-bat was arboreal, but diurnal and frugivorous. After the evolution of flight it is suggested that these animals were driven into the nocturnal niche by the evolution of raptorial birds, and different groups evolved either specialised nocturnal vision (megachiropterans) or echolocation (microchiropterans). A block on sensory modality transfer has retained this distribution of perceptual capabilities ever since, despite some Megachiroptera evolving rudimentary echolocation, and the dietary convergence of some Microchiroptera with the Megachiroptera. The new hypothesis overcomes many of the problems identified in previous treatments.","2001","2025-02-10 20:46:09","2025-02-10 20:46:09","2025-02-10 20:46:09","111-130","","2","31","","","The evolution of flight and echolocation in bats","","","","","","","en","© 2001 Mammal Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2907.2001.00082.x","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\7NHGEMQM\Speakman - 2001 - The evolution of flight and echolocation in bats another leap in the dark.pdf","","","evolution; Chiroptera; echolocation; flight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, morphological variation related to other drivers of adaptation, in particular echolocation, remains understudied. We assessed variation in skull morphology with respect to ecology (diet and emission type) and function (bite force, masticatory muscles and echolocation characteristics) using geometric morphometrics and comparative methods. Our study suggests that variation in skull shape of 10 bat families is the result of adaptations to broad dietary categories and sound emission types (oral or nasal). Skull shape correlates with echolocation parameters only in a subsample of insectivorous species, possibly because they (almost) entirely rely on this sensory system for locating and capturing prey. Insectivores emitting low frequencies are characterized by a ventrally tilted rostrum, a trait not associated with feeding parameters. This result questions the validity of a trade-off between feeding and echolocation function. Our study advances understanding of the relationship between skull morphology and specific features of echolocation and suggests that evolutionary constraints due to echolocation may differ between different groups within the Chiroptera.","2022","2025-02-10 20:46:16","2025-02-10 20:46:16","2025-02-10 20:46:16","430-442","","3","17","","","Functional correlates of skull shape in Chiroptera","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Authors.

Despite being sensitive to water loss, bats successfully inhabit a wide range of arid lands. We here investigated how functional traits of bat assemblages vary along the global aridity gradient to identify traits that favour their persistence in arid environments. Location Global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Bats. Methods We mapped the assemblage-level averages of four key bat traits describing wing morphology, echolocation and body size, based on a grid of 100-km resolution and a pool of 915 bat species, and modelled them against aridity values. To support our results, we conducted analyses also at the species level to control for phylogenetic autocorrelation. Results At the assemblage level, we detected a rise in values of aspect ratio, wing loading and forearm length, and a decrease in echolocation frequency with increasing aridity. These patterns were consistent with trends detected at the species level for all traits. Main conclusions Our findings show that trait variation in bats is associated with the aridity gradient and suggest that greater mobility and larger body size are advantageous features in arid environments. Greater mobility favours bats’ ability to track patchy and temporary resources, while the reduced surface-to-volume ratio associated with a larger body size is likely to reduce water stress by limiting cutaneous evaporation. These findings highlight the importance of extending attention from species-specific adaptations to broad scale and multispecies variation in traits when investigating the ability of species to withstand arid conditions.","2021","2025-02-10 20:46:27","2025-02-10 20:46:27","2025-02-10 20:46:27","1014-1029","","5","30","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Authors.

Studies addressing the identification of patterns and variations across several guilds are fundamental in ecomorphological research. Wings are the core of ecological morphology in bats; nevertheless, individual bones and structures that support the wing, including metacarpals, phalanges and the length of digits, have rarely been the subject of comprehensive research when studying wing morphology. Here, I analyzed morphological variations of wing structures across 11 bat guilds and how individual bone structures are correlated to diet, foraging mode and habitat use. I obtained wing measurements from 1512 voucher specimens of 97 species. All the specimens analyzed came from the Mammalian Collection at the Museo Javeriano de Historia Natural of Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (MPUJ-MAMM) (Bogotá, Colombia). Positive correlations between size and the length of the third and fifth digit were detected. Bat guilds that capture their preys using aerial strategy in uncluttered habitats had longer third digits but short fifth digits compared to guilds that rely on gleaning strategy and forage in highly cluttered space. Although terminal phalanges were shown to be important structures for guild classification, metacarpals were strongly related to aerial foragers from uncluttered habitats because of their potential role in flight performance and ecological adaptations. Results show that habitat use, as well as foraging mode, are reflected in wing structures. Different wing traits to those evaluated in this study should be considered to better understand the ecological interactions, foraging strategy, wing adaptations, and flight performance in Neotropical bats.","2020-11-20","2025-02-10 20:48:23","2025-02-10 20:48:23","2025-02-10 20:48:23","e60","","","59","","Zool Stud","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 34140977 PMCID: PMC8181164","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Y6T2I58Z\Castillo-Figueroa - 2020 - Ecological Morphology of Neotropical Bat Wing Structures.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8181164/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed the effect of habitat type using taxonomic and functional α-diversity and functional uniqueness at the community-level.

Furthermore, we estimated the contribution of “richness change” and “replacement” components among habitats using functional β-diversity. Forested habitats (forest fragments and continuous forest) retained more diverse functional assemblages compared to savannahs, with a greater abundance of species with unique traits, such as the gleaning insectivorous bats (e.g., Gardnerycteris crenulatum, Lophostoma silvicola, Tonatia maresi). Functional β-diversity between forest fragments and savannah was driven significantly by the replacement of traits, indicating the substitution of species that perform different ecological functions in these habitats.

In both the 1998 and 2006 classifications of bats into suborders (Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera versus Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, respectively), some convergences between suborders are the same (e.g., foliage roosting, tent building), but others associated with echolocation differ substantially. In the 1998 phylogeny convergences associated with echolocation (high duty cycle echolocation, nasal emission of echolocation calls) occurred among the Microchiroptera. In the 2006 phylogeny, they occur between Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera. While some traits apparently arose independently in two suborders (e.g., foliage-roosting, tent building, low intensity echolocation calls, noseleafs, nasal emission of echolocation calls, high duty cycle echolocation behaviour), others appear to have been ancestral (roosting in narrow spaces, laryngeal echolocation, stylohyal-tympanic contact, oral emission of echolocation calls, and small litter size). A narrow profile through the chest is typical of bats reflecting the thoracic skeleton. This feature suggests that the ancestors of bats spent the day in small crevices. Features associated with laryngeal echolocation appear to be ancestral, suggesting that echolocation evolved early in bats but was subsequently lost in one yinpterochiropteran lineage.","2010-08-01","2025-02-10 20:50:09","2025-02-10 20:50:09","2025-02-10 20:50:09","454-468","","4","56","","Current Zoology","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\3RP35U8N\Fenton - 2010 - Convergences in the diversification of bats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While size and morphological adaptations for carnivory have been identified in other taxa, it is unclear what phenotypic traits characterize the relatively recent evolution of carnivory in bats. To address this gap, we apply geometric morphometric and phylogenetic comparative analyses to elucidate which characters are associated with ecological divergence of carnivorous bats from insectivorous ancestors, and if there is morphological convergence among independent origins of carnivory within bats, and with other carnivorous mammals. We find that carnivorous bats are larger and converged to occupy a subset of the insectivorous morphospace, characterized by skull shapes that enhance bite force at relatively wide gapes. Piscivorous bats are morphologically distinct, with cranial shapes that enable high bite force at narrow gapes, which is necessary for processing fish prey. All animal-eating species exhibit positive allometry in rostrum elongation with respect to skull size, which could allow larger bats to take relatively larger prey. The skull shapes of carnivorous bats share similarities with generalized carnivorans, but tend to be more suited for increased bite force production at the expense of gape, when compared with specialized carnivorans.","2016-05-11","2025-02-10 20:50:52","2025-02-10 20:50:52","2025-02-10 20:50:52","20160615","","1830","283","","","Go big or go fish","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\V67WMTFC\Santana y Cheung - 2016 - Go big or go fish morphological specializations in carnivorous bats.pdf","","","Chiroptera; piscivory; allometry; carnivory; Carnivora","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With world-wide changes in human land use, an important challenge for conservation biologists is to develop frameworks to predict how species will respond to landscape change. Environmental filtering, where different environments favour different species’ traits, has the potential to be a useful predictive framework. Therefore, it is important to advance our understanding of how species with different traits respond to environmental variables. 2. We investigated the distribution of microbats in a 1 000 000 ha agricultural region in southeastern Australia, with specific emphasis on the effects of tree density on bat species characterized by different sizes, wing shapes and echolocation frequencies. The study area is substantially cleared, and trees are continuing to decline because grazing inhibits tree regeneration. We monitored bat activity acoustically at 80 sites spanning a wide range of tree densities. We used regression modelling to quantify the response of bats to tree density and other ecological covariates, and RLQ analysis to assess how different traits correlated with various environmental gradients. 3. Total bat activity and species richness peaked at intermediate tree densities. Species composition was explained by tree density and the traits of individual species. Sites with low tree cover were dominated by large, fast-flying species, whereas sites with dense tree cover were dominated by smaller, highly manoeuvrable species. These findings are consistent with recent findings from other locations around the world. 4. Synthesis and applications. Trait-based predictive frameworks enable landscape managers to assess how different management strategies and landscape modifications are likely to affect different species. Here, we propose a framework to derive general predictions of how bats respond to landscape modification, based on tree density and species traits. We apply this framework to a current conservation issue of tree decline in our study area and derive management priorities including: (i) maintaining a range of tree densities throughout the region; (ii) ensuring the persistence of locations with intermediate tree densities; and (iii) using environmentally sensitive grazing practices, for example, by incorporating long rest periods.","2012","2025-02-10 20:51:06","2025-02-10 20:51:06","2025-02-10 20:51:06","842-850","","4","49","","","Using trait-based filtering as a predictive framework for conservation","","","","","","","en","© 2012 The Authors.

However, information on how teeth perform under natural conditions is rare, which limits the understanding of how dental morphology influences dietary ecology and niche partitioning within animal communities. Free-tailed bats (Chiroptera: Molossidae) are a diverse clade of aerial insectivorous mammals that exhibit an outstanding variation in size and craniodental traits, which have been directly related to ecological segregation among sympatric species. We investigate the mechanisms that allow functional dietary specialization and trophic segregation among sympatric free-tailed bat species inhabiting a Neotropical forest. To do so, we coupled data on 3D dental topographic metrics, head and skull dimensions, field-collected feeding performance and dietary hardness measurements. We found that evolved differences in molar topography and skull size vary in tandem with the mechanical demands of prey items naturally consumed by sympatric molossid species. This may be explained by feeding performance capabilities resulting from both molar shape and the overall size of the feeding apparatus, which seem to allow efficient processing of prey items with specific mechanical properties. For instance, smaller bats with higher molar topographic values (sharper, more complex molars) and more gracile heads mainly feed on softer insects, whereas bigger bats with lower molar topographic values (blunter, less complex molars) and more robust heads mostly feed on tougher insects. Species with a broader range of sizes, craniodental morphologies and insect hardness are also present in the community. These results illustrate how the morphology and size of feeding structures, and how they perform, may facilitate trophic segregation among sympatric insectivorous bats. Similar mechanisms may help structure other communities of insectivorous mammals, therefore the approaches presented here could be used to generate a better understanding of the ecomorphological traits and processes that underlie their diversity.

Traits are interrelated and sometimes involve trade-offs, implying that a change in one trait may have positive or negative consequences for other traits. We describe the main morphological, physiological and ecological adaptations of insectivorous European bat species. We make pair-wise relations between traits, indicating the interrelations between traits, in terms of possible trade-offs. We relate the consequences of these trade-offs to the distribution maps of the species, focusing on the traits relevant for southern and northern distribution limits. We found coarse patterns that might indicate the distribution of related species are a consequence of their physiological, morphological and ecological adaptations and the interrelations between these adaptations. Hence, we think life-history strategies can be used to explain differences in species distribution.

This allowed us to identify potential mechanisms underlying the response of bat communities to human disturbance. Our results showed that the species negatively affected by the anthropoghenic disturbance are those with greater body mass, larger nose-leaves, or a lower wing aspect ratio and relative wing loading, which perform low-speed flights and have high maneuverability and, potentially, a high directionality in their emissions. We also detected a greater sensitivity of bats to changes in the landscape attributes regarding the riparian than the dry forest, and that the effect of anthropic transformation on bats was intensified during the dry season.

This complex relationship is further influenced by the rarely considered role of phenotypic plasticity in the evolution of adaptive population variation. Plasticity can be adaptive if it promotes colonization and survival in novel environments and in doing so may increase the potential for future population differentiation via selection. Gene flow between selectively divergent environments may favour the evolution of phenotypic plasticity or conversely, plasticity itself may promote gene flow, leading to a pattern of trait differentiation in the presence of gene flow. Variation in sensory traits is particularly informative in testing the role of environment in trait and population differentiation. Here we test the hypothesis of ‘adaptive differentiation with minimal gene flow’ in resting echolocation frequencies (RF) of Cape horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus capensis) across a gradient of increasingly cluttered habitats.","2014-03-27","2025-02-10 20:53:40","2025-02-10 20:53:40","2025-02-10 20:53:40","60","","1","14","","BMC Evol Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\JRWVVBQE\Odendaal et al. - 2014 - Sensory trait variation in an echolocating bat suggests roles for both selection and plasticity.pdf","","","Mitochondrial DNA; Gene flow; Neutral evolution; Resting echolocation frequency; Rhinolophidae; Sensory ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, bat flight is a highly complex functional system from a morphological, physiological, and aerodynamic perspective, and the transition from a gliding precursor may involve functional discontinuities that represent evolutionary hurdles. In this review, I suggest a framework for a comprehensive treatment of the evolution of complex functional systems that emphasizes a mechanistic understanding of the initial state, the final state, and the proposed transitional states. In this case, bats represent the final state and extant mammalian gliders are used as a model for the initial state. To explore possible transitional states, I propose a set of criteria for evaluating hypotheses about the evolution of flight in vertebrates and suggest methods by which we can advance our understanding of the transition from gliding to flapping flight. Although it is impossible ever to know with certainty the sequence of events leading to flapping flight, the field of possibilities can be narrowed to those that maintain the functional continuity of the wing and result in improved aerodynamic performance across this transition. The fundamental differences between gliding and flapping flight should not necessarily be seen as evidence that this transition could not occur; rather, these differences point out compelling aspects of the aerodynamics of animal wings that require further investigation.","2008-06","2025-02-10 20:53:50","2025-02-10 20:53:50","2025-02-10 20:53:50","153-169","","2","83","","","The Evolution of Flight in Bats","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","","","","biomechanics; aerodynamics; complex functional systems; compliant wings; evolutionary transitions; functional shift; gliding; low aspect ratio wings; origin of flight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That is only part of the story, however. Bats have diversified into trophic niches that range from insectivory to feeding on blood, fruit, or nectar. While flight places fundamental constraints on the shape of the postcranial skeleton, skull shape in bats is remarkably diverse. Morphological studies of individual families and sympatric assemblages demonstrate that variation in skull shape is clearly associated with trophic specialization. Field experiments demonstrate that species-specific biting behaviors during feeding are common and analyses indicate that the evolution of cranial morphology and feeding behavior are correlated. Modeling experiments further suggest that feeding (loading) behaviors and skull shape are functionally linked. If the skulls of bats are under selective pressure for minimal mass because of the energetic demands of flight, then they may be more “optimized” to meet mechanical demands than are the skulls of other mammals. This would make bats a unique model system for studying the evolution of diversity in skull shape and its functional implications for the evolution of feeding strategies in mammals.","2007-07-01","2025-02-10 20:53:58","2025-02-10 20:53:58","2025-02-10 20:53:58","137-146","","1","47","","Integrative and Comparative Biology","Feeding mechanisms in bats","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we describe how comparative chiropteran laryngeal morphology is a novel area of research that could improve the understanding of echolocation and may help resolve the evolutionary history of bats. This review provides morphological descriptions and comparisons of the bat larynx and bioacoustics interpretations. We discuss the importance of understanding: (1) laryngeal sound production so it may be linked with the evolution of the chiropteran auditory system; and (2) the evolution of laryngeal morphology to understand the ecological and behavioural aspects of bat biology. We find that a strong phylogenetic signal is potentially the main source explaining macroevolutionary variation in laryngeal form among bats.

Males of many mammal species tend to be larger or more ornamented than females, and these characteristics tend to be more pronounced in polygynous, diurnal, and open-habitat species. Bats have long been considered a largely non-sexually dimorphic group due to lack of conspicuous differences in body size and other cranial and skeletal characters. However, bats, like many mammals, exhibit a diverse array of soft-tissue integumentary glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures with intense odorous substances that have not been thoroughly investigated, although postulated functions include facilitating mate selection in their generally polygynous associations. To date, there has been no systematic assessment of the occurrence or expression of sexually dimorphic traits in bats, many of which show intriguing sexual dimorphism in soft tissue, and most of which involve intense odours. In this study, we review evidence of integumentary glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures known in bats, as a first step towards identifying future research pathways to study sexual dimorphism in bats. Highly variable glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures have been noticed in ten different regions of the body, but are most frequently found on the head and the ventral region of the neck. They have been described in nearly 9% of bat species and in 70% of 21 extant bat families. Our review, based on extremely scattered and unevenly detailed literature, unveils the extraordinary sexual dimorphism that has been observed in Chiroptera to date, identifying not only target body parts where sexually dimorphic traits are likely to be found, but also critical avenues for future investigation and discoveries, and stressing the importance of the timing of secondary sexual trait observations, behavioural studies, and chemical analyses.","2021","2025-02-10 20:54:39","2025-02-10 20:54:39","2025-02-10 20:54:39","155-177","","2","51","","","Redefining the study of sexual dimorphism in bats","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12232","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\EU8PC892\Muñoz-Romo et al. - 2021 - Redefining the study of sexual dimorphism in bats following the odour trail.pdf","","","Chiroptera; bat courtship signals; chemical communication; comunicación química; dimorfismo sexual; glands; glándulas; odours; olores; selección sexual; señales de cortejo de murciélagos; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among mammals, bats possess unique traits that place unusual demands on their vestibular systems. First, bats are capable of powered flight, which in birds is associated with enlarged semicircular canals. Second, many bats have enlarged cochleae associated with echolocation, and both cochleae and semicircular canals share a space within the petrosal bone. To determine how bat vestibular systems have evolved in the face of these pressures, we used micro-CT scans to compare canal morphology across species with contrasting flight and echolocation capabilities. We found no increase in canal radius in bats associated with the acquisition of powered flight, but canal radius did correlate with body mass in bat species from the suborder Yangochiroptera, and also in non-echolocating Old World fruit bats from the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. No such trend was seen in members of the Yinpterochiroptera that use laryngeal echolocation, although canal radius was associated with wing-tip roundedness in this group. We also found that the vestibular system scaled with cochlea size, although the relationship differed in species that use constant frequency echolocation. Across all bats, the shape of the anterior and lateral canals was associated with large cochlea size and small body size respectively, suggesting differential spatial constraints on each canal depending on its orientation within the skull. Thus in many echolocating bats, it seems that the combination of small body size and enlarged cochlea together act as a principal force on the vestibular system. The two main groups of echolocating bats displayed different canal morphologies, in terms of size and shape in relation to body mass and cochlear size, thus suggesting independent evolutionary pathways and offering tentative support for multiple acquisitions of echolocation.","2013-04-24","2025-02-10 20:54:45","2025-02-10 20:54:45","2025-02-10 20:54:45","e61998","","4","8","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\8PPM5Q6Z\Davies et al. - 2013 - The Evolution of Bat Vestibular Systems in the Face of Potential Antagonistic Selection Pressures fo.pdf","","","Mammals; Echolocation; Fruit bats; Animal flight; Bat flight; Animal wings; Cochlea; Semicircular canals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, empirical information about how and how much different bat species capture and consume fish is limited and is probably distorted due to the biases introduced by occasional observations. In this review, we aim to synthesise the knowledge so far generated on fishing bats, in order to 1) assess the incidence of fishing in different bat species; 2) discuss the evolutionary framework and origins of fishing behaviour; and 3) identify the ecological challenges of fishing and review the state of knowledge about kinetic, morphological, sensory, behavioural, and physiological adaptations related to fishing. Fishing bats can be clustered into three groups based on the incidence of fish consumption. Noctilio leporinus is the only species in which fishing is widespread (occurring in most populations) and common (occurring most of the time and carried out by many individuals). Myotis vivesi, Myotis pilosus, and Myotis capaccinii comprise the second group, characterised by exhibiting regular fishing behaviour that is restricted to a limited number of populations. Noctilio albiventris, Myotis daubentonii, and Myotis macropus are classified in a third group, because although the occasional presence of fish traces in faeces has been reported, regular fishing behaviour in the wild has not been confirmed. Fishing was developed independently multiple times in different bat lineages, probably under different selective pressures and ecological scenarios. Nevertheless, all fishing species face similar challenges in terms of detecting, capturing, handling, and metabolising fish, which require specific kinetic, morphological, sensory, behavioural, and physiological adaptations. Both basic information about fishing behaviour in different species and specific knowledge of the biological adaptation are still missing. Thus, in this review we identify gaps in the knowledge and suggest experimental approaches to overcome them.","2018","2025-02-10 20:54:56","2025-02-10 20:54:56","2025-02-10 20:54:56","284-297","","4","48","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12136","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RF3TFIXF\Aizpurua y Alberdi - 2018 - Ecology and evolutionary biology of fishing bats.pdf","","","Chiroptera; behavioural adaptations; diet specialisation; piscivory; trawling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of nearly 1,000 species worldwide, 239 are considered threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and 12 are extinct. Small geographic ranges and low wing aspect ratios are independently found to predict extinction risk in bats, which explains 48% of the total variance in IUCN assessments of threat. The pattern and correlates of extinction risk in the two bat suborders are significantly different. A higher proportion (4%) of megachiropteran species have gone extinct in the last 500 years than microchiropteran bats (0.3%), and a higher proportion is currently at risk of extinction (Megachiroptera: 34%; Microchiroptera: 22%). While correlates of microchiropteran extinction risk are the same as in the order as a whole, megachiropteran extinction is correlated more with reproductive rate and less with wing morphology. Bat extinction risk is not randomly distributed phylogenetically: closely related species have more similar levels of threat than would be expected if extinction risk were random. Given the unbalanced nature of the evolutionary diversification of bats, it is probable that the amount of phylogenetic diversity lost if currently threatened taxa disappear may be greater than in other clades with numerically more threatened species.","2003-04","2025-02-10 20:55:03","2025-02-10 20:55:03","2025-02-10 20:55:03","601-614","","4","161","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","","","","geographic range; extinction risk; bats; wing morphology; independent contrasts; predictive model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our goals were to test alternative phylogenetic hypotheses by examining DNA sequences (1.4 kb) from a nuclear gene (recombination-activating gene-2; Rag2) and, if appropriate, to examine family-level relationships based on concatenation of Rag2 and mtDNA sequences (4.1 kb). Relationships suggested by parsimony and Bayesian analysis of Rag2 data were congruent with mtDNA, and combined analysis afforded high statistical support for all but 2 clades.

A truss network is used to quantify changes in the size and shape of the wing membrane during morphogenesis. Growth of the forearm and of third and fifth digits of the manus are also quantified. Principal component analysis indicates that changes in size of the wing (PC-1) contribute 78% of growth variation, whereas shape changes (PC-2, PC-3) contribute only about 18% of growth variation. ANOVA run on component scores shows significant differences in size (PC-1) of the wing between juveniles and sub-adults, whereas no significant difference in shape (PC-2 and 3) of the wing occurs during morphogenesis. In addition, growth compensation is shown to occur among sequentially developing skeletal elements comprising the hand wing. Coefficients of variation were significantly higher for phalangeal lengths than for total wing length and width. Compensation scores generated by summing residual scores produced by bivariate plots of wing bone elements show variable levels of compensation among individuals. However, a plot of scores against wing length shows compensation to occur throughout morphogenesis as scores are not correlated with wing size (r= 0.089). Apparently, selection has favoured a developmental system within which wing shape is conserved while simultaneous plasticity in the hand skeleton helps maintain functional integrity during rapid morphogenesis.","1998","2025-02-10 20:55:21","2025-02-10 20:55:21","2025-02-10 20:55:21","165-174","","2","246","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1998.tb00145.x","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\E2TXFRCK\Adams - 1998 - Evolutionary implications of developmental and functional integration in bat wings.pdf","","","ontogeny; flight; Myotis lucifugus; developmental integration; functional integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, conflicting selective pressures may make predictions about diet difficult without additional knowledge of a species' life history. We tested the reliability of predicting a bat's diet from its wing morphology using data for Spix's disk-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor). The species had been predicted to fall within either the aerial hawking or gleaning foraging group. We compared the results of a theoretical (canonical discriminant function analysis of morphology) and an applied (analysis of droppings) method of diet determination. Our results place T. tricolor in the gleaning functional group with a 77% probability according to morphology. Correspondingly, a large proportion of the diverse diet consisted of nonflying prey, such as spiders, insect larvae, and other silent prey, which should be difficult to detect using echolocation. Although some flying prey were taken, it is clear that T. tricolor regularly gleans prey from surfaces, indicating that for this species, morphology is a useful indicator of diet. However, the breadth of the diet; the high proportion of jumping spiders, leafhoppers, and insect larvae; and the extremely small size of prey were unique features of the diet that could not be predicted from morphology alone. Thus, although comparative statistical methods and the analysis of wing morphology may be helpful to predict the general ecological niche, only detailed investigation of the life history may yield the detail needed for understanding the link between morphology and ecology of individual species.","2006-10-17","2025-02-10 20:55:28","2025-02-10 20:55:28","2025-02-10 20:55:28","1013-1019","","5","87","","Journal of Mammalogy","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\6C7SCLN6\Dechmann et al. - 2006 - Matching Morphology and Diet in the Disc-Winged Bat Thyroptera tricolor (Chiroptera).pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location Mountain ranges in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Methods We compiled a dataset with the composition of phyllostomid bat assemblages at 32 forested sites, ranging from 60 m to 1,960 m a.s.l. We quantified how abundance and diversity changed along this elevational gradient, and assessed the capacity of each species to be present and abundant at each elevation, identifying traits that may influence that capacity. Results Abundance and species diversity declined markedly with increasing elevation. Tolerance to low temperatures, low habitat specialization and cave roosting facilitated success at higher elevations. Owing to trait filtering, and to changes in resource availability with elevation, assemblages were progressively dominated by a smaller number of mostly generalist species as elevation increased. Higher elevations harbour only a subset of the species that are present in the lowland forest, with no mountain specialized species. Main conclusions High mountains harbour phyllostomid assemblages that are impoverished subsets of those at lower elevations. Phyllostomids have a tropical origin and may thus have a low potential to adapt to montane forest environments, which possibly explains the observed climatic trait filtering. Habitat filtering is also important, keeping forest specialists mostly at lowest elevations. Protected areas in the Atlantic Forest are mostly limited to mountains. While these areas are clearly important to protect biodiversity, including phyllostomid assemblages, it is now critical to protect and restore the few remnants of lower elevation Atlantic Forest where higher productivity and resource levels, increased complexity of vertical structure, and fewer climatic constraints favour the success of a wider range of phyllostomid bat species of tropical origin.","2019","2025-02-10 20:55:35","2025-02-10 20:55:35","2025-02-10 20:55:35","316-331","","2","46","","","Traits that allow bats of tropical lowland origin to conquer mountains","","","","","","","en","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jbi.13506","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\SNSXIVU6\de Carvalho et al. - 2019 - Traits that allow bats of tropical lowland origin to conquer mountains Bat assemblages along elevat.pdf","","","Brazil; Chiroptera; elevation; Mantiqueira Mountains; mountain conservation; phyllostomid bats; Serra do Mar Mountains; tropical animal ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Small non-volant mammals occupy the fast/high end in both continua with high reproductive rates and short life spans linked with high mass-specific metabolic rates. Bats occupy the high end of the metabolic continuum, but the slow end of the life-history continuum with low reproductive rates and long life spans. Typically, both continua are linked, and similar life-history traits of species are reflected in more similar metabolic rates. We therefore hypothesized that metabolic rates are similar in species with similar life-history traits. Resting metabolic rates (RMR) were measured for three ecologically and morphologically similar sympatric bat species (Myotis nattereri, M. bechsteinii, and Plecotus auritus; Vespertilionidae) and compared to data from other similar-sized, temperate insectivorous mammals with other life-history strategies. The bat species share similar life-histories and RMRs, both of which differ from the remaining mammals and therefore supporting our hypothesis. To verify that bats are similar in RMR, two energetically contrasting periods were compared. RMRs in post-lactating females did not differ between bat species. It was, however, positively correlated with parasite load in both Myotis species. However, RMRs differed during energy-demanding pregnancy where M. nattereri had the significantly lowest RMR, suggesting metabolic compensation as an energy-saving strategy. We conclude that the energy requirements of bat species with similar life-history traits resemble each other during periods of low energetic demands and are more similar to each other than to other small temperate mammals.","2013-03-01","2025-02-10 20:57:57","2025-02-10 20:57:57","2025-02-10 20:57:57","249-258","","2","28","","Ecol Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\G2QR9I2P\Becker et al. - 2013 - Energetics and life-history of bats in comparison to small mammals.pdf","","","Compensation; Ecophysiology; Energy demand; Energy-saving mechanisms; Respirometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, human-caused environmental changes are jeopardizing bat communities, which results in the loss of functional roles provided by them. It is important, therefore, to assess ecological processes performed by bats in the Neotropics to define priorities in further research for better conservation planning. In this systematic review, I identify general trends, advances, bias, and knowledge gaps in bat-mediated ecological processes across Neotropical ecosystems. I have conducted an extensive search on Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and Bat Eco–Interactions Database resulting in 538 references, of which 185 papers were included in the review. The papers were published in 76 peer-reviewed journals, with the highest peak between 2006-2010. From the six biomes recorded, Moist broadleaf tropical forest was the most researched, contrary to Montane biomes (&gt;2000 m), where few studies have been conducted. Seed dispersal was the process with more studies (44%), followed by pollination (38%), nutrient cycling (10%), and arthropod suppression (8%). Seed dispersal and pollination displayed large bias on specific bat-plant systems (Artibeus-Ficus, Sturnira-Solanum, Carollia-Piper, Pachycereeae tribe-Leptonycteris) and ecoregions (Ithsmian-Atlantic moist forest, Cerrado, Tehuacán Valley matorral), thus being important to explore other bat and plant species as well as other ecosystems. Arthropod suppression and nutrient cycling were largely overlooked despite constituting essential functions in ecosystem resilience; particularly, more research is needed to know cascading effects on plant fitness in different agroforestry systems, but also is key the understanding of how bats can be pivotal mobile links in terrestrial ecosystems and cave environments. I highlight the importance to consider bats with multiple roles and functional trait-based approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of their functionality. Even though functional studies have increased in the last two decades, several aspects of bat roles are still obscured, and is necessary to keep evaluating their ecological and economic importance to provide useful information for major decision-makings in Neotropical ecosystems’ conservation. Bat extirpations are likely to affect their ecological roles, therefore, mitigating major threats of bats are urgently needed to sustain ecosystem integrity in the Neotropics.","2020-08-19","2025-02-10 20:58:12","2025-02-10 20:58:12","2025-02-10 20:58:12","77-101","","1","6","","","Why bats matters","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2020 Dennis Castillo-Figueroa","","","","journals.ku.edu","","Number: 1","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\7SH6GM62\Castillo-Figueroa - 2020 - Why bats matters A critical assessment of bat-mediated ecological processes in the Neotropics.pdf","","","Chiroptera; Ecosystems; Pollination; Arthropod suppression; Functional roles; Functional trait; Neotropical Region; New World Bats.; Nutrient cycling; Seed dispersal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Empirical evidence regarding this question remains limited for many tropical regions despite their importance for conservation. Here, we used body mass, wing morphology, trophic level, and diet to identify which traits make phyllostomid bat species more vulnerable to human impacts in the Colombian Orinoco Llanos. Bats were sampled using mist nets in riparian forests, unflooded forests, flooded savannahs, and conventional rice crops on traditional farmlands with high-intensity agriculture and in private reserves with greater ecosystem protection. We tested the associations between species traits and landscape-structure variables (habitat cover and type, number of habitat patches, shortest distance to water) using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, accounting for both spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelation. Trophic level and diet were the most important traits linked to disturbance sensitivity. Our results indicated that rice crop cover, savannah patches, and altered unflooded forest act as a filter, benefiting disturbance-adapted frugivorous genera in farmlands (e.g., Artibeus spp., Carollia spp., Platyrrhinus spp., Uroderma spp.). Conversely, animalivorous species were strongly associated with savannah cover and riparian forests within reserves (e.g., Lampronycteris brachyotis, Lophostoma brasiliense, Micronycteris minuta, Trachops cirrhosus). Encouraging the creation of more wildlife-friendly landscapes through payments for ecosystem services across the Colombian Llanos will ensure the long-term persistence of disturbance-sensitive species and sustain a complete set of ecological functions and ecosystem services that these bats provide.","2024-03-01","2025-02-10 20:58:27","2025-02-10 20:58:27","2025-02-10 20:58:27","1285-1302","","4","33","","Biodivers Conserv","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\TMYF953Y\Otálora-Ardila et al. - 2024 - Trait-mediated filtering predicts phyllostomid bat responses to habitat disturbance in the Orinoco L.pdf","","","Chiroptera; Functional traits; Environmental filters; Land-use change; Landscape composition and configuration; Llanos Orientales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The distribution of body sizes among mammalian species has been modelled by Brown, Marquet & Taper (1993), who suggest that reproductive power (the rate at which energy from the environment is channelled into offspring production) is maximized at a size of 100 g, and the observed size distribution among species reflects the way reproductive power depends on size. The model makes a testable prediction about life-history allometries: namely, that components of reproductive power should not scale linearly with body size but should change sign at the optimum size. 2. A large set of life-history data from a single clade of small mammals, the bats (Order: Chiroptera), was analysed to test this key prediction. The analyses in this study offer no support for the idea that allometries of reproductive power change sign in bats, either at 100 g or at any other size. Furthermore the life-history allometries of bats, which are mostly below the 100 g optimum, were broadly the same as in mammalian taxa larger than the optimum size. 3.

This has generated strong selective pressure on the morphology and function of their digestive system. Given that in bats intestinal length and nominal surface-area are proportional to body mass, this trait importantly relates to explaining some of their digestive characteristics. We described the relationship between digestive traits and body mass of four species of bats of the family Vespertilionidae living in a montane ecosystem in central Mexico. We calculated food transit time, apparent dry matter digestibility, and defecation rate in feeding trials under captive conditions. We also: (1) built a model of the relationship between digestive traits and body mass to determine if this association was consistent within the members of the family Vespertilionidae, and (2) mapped these traits along the phylogeny to explore how digestive characteristics may have evolved. In our feeding trials, body mass was positively related to transit time and negatively related to apparent dry matter digestibility. The model predicted accurately the transit time in bats with body mass < 20 g. The phylogenetic approach suggested that over the evolutionary history of the family, transit time decreased as digestibility increased. Because of the results obtained here, it is likely that for most bats of the family Vespertilionidae, adaptations in digestive traits to process food have followed evolutionary changes in their body mass. We discuss these findings in a physiological and ecological context.","2021-03-01","2025-02-10 20:58:57","2025-02-10 20:58:57","2025-02-10 20:58:57","427-438","","2","191","","J Comp Physiol B","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\M8ZV4ZEP\Cabrera-Campos et al. - 2021 - Body mass explains digestive traits in small vespertilionid bats.pdf","","","Bats; Vespertilionidae; Body mass; Digestion; Evolutionary approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, broad comparative analyses of sensory morphologies and their performance are lacking for diverse mammalian radiations. Neotropical leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are one of the most ecologically diverse mammal groups; including a wide range of diets and foraging behaviours, and extreme morphological variation in external sensory structures used in echolocation (nose leaf and pinnae). We coupled 3D geometric morphometrics and acoustic field recordings under a phylogenetic framework to investigate the mechanisms underlying the diversification of external sensory morphologies in phyllostomids, and explored the potential implications of sensory morphological diversity to functional outputs and dietary ecology. We found that the nose leaf consists of two evolutionary modules—spear and horseshoe—suggesting that modularity enabled morphological and functional diversification of this structure. We found a significant association between some aspects of nose leaf shape and maximum frequency and bandwidth of echolocation calls, but not between pinnae shape and echolocation call parameters. This may be explained by the use of multiple sensory modes across phyllostomids and plasticity of some echolocation call parameters. Species with different diets significantly differed in nose leaf shape, specifically in spear breadth, presence of a midrib, and cupping and anterior rotation of the horseshoe. This may relate to different levels of prey type specificity within each diet. Pinnae shape significantly differed between species that consume non-mobile, non-evasive prey (broad rounded, cupped pinnae) and mobile, evasive prey (flattened pinnae with a sharp tapering apex). This may reflect the use of different sound cues to detect prey.

The wing variables, including forearm length, aspect ratio, relative wing loading, and wing tip shape index, were assessed using museum and private specimens of 34 Japanese bat species. Hierarchical clustering of the wing variables classified the bats into nine clusters to predict their foraging ecology, including the species for which ecological knowledge was lacking. Based on the ecological knowledge of Japanese bats, the aspect ratio of bats belonging to the open-space foraging guild was significantly higher than that of those belonging to other guilds. In contrast, the wing tip shape index of bats belonging to the narrow-space foraging guild was significantly higher than those belonging to the other guilds.

We correlated the results with ecological information. Aspect ratio, wing span, wing area, wing loading and the second moment of area of humerus midshaft were estimated for the molossid Mormopterus kalinowskii, the phyllostomidae Desmodus rotundus and the vespertilionids Histiotus montanus, Histiotus macrotus, Lasiurus borealis, and Lasiurus cinereus. The free-tailed bats T. brasiliensis and M.kalinowskii and D. rotundus, without uropatagyum, showed a low wing area, but whilst the molossids showed large aspect ratios, that of D. rotundus was only moderate. Desmodus rotundus showed the lowest wing span (relative to the expected one) and the largest wing loading. The second moment of area of the humerus midshaft of M. chiloensis is lower than the expected values from the allometric predictions, suggesting poorer resistance to bending and torsional forces. All other vespertilionids, showed a high second moment of area of humerus. This may be explained by the highly expensive form of locomotion, especially in species with high parasite power as a consequence of their long ears. The high Ih of D. rotundus that can be explained by its high body mass which increase the torque produced by the weight and a low aspect ratio. The principal component analysis showed two orthogonal axes, the first correlated positively with the wing loading and negatively with the mass corrected wingspan and the second component with the aerodynamic efficiency parameter, AR. Four functional groups, one per quadrant, were described: (1) Desmodus rotundus, with high wing loading but low corrected wing span, was in the increased agility zone, with moderate power consumption during flight; (2) the molossids were located in the high speed flight and low total power zone, showing a high aerodynamic efficiency; (3) most of vespertilionids were in the zone of low speed but increased maneuverability, their aspect ratios and wing loading were relatively low; (4) Lasiurus cinereus was in the zone of fast speed flight and the low aspect ratio predicts an increased agility.

In the face of climate change, many of these species are being pushed higher to escape ever-increasing temperatures. Despite this, we have little understanding of how species distribute themselves across mountains. African mountains in particular are less studied than mountains elsewhere and the small mammal groups that inhabit them are also poorly studied when compared to other groups. In this study, we examined the responses of three functionally distinct small mammal taxonomic groups to changes in elevation across Africa. Location Africa. Methods We calculated four functional diversity metrics for 166, 97 and 153 communities of rodents, bats and shrews comprising 225, 183 and 109 species, respectively. We employed RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to identify any associations between the functional traits of the small mammals and elevation and other climatic variables. Results We show that the species richness of the three taxa responded differently to increases in elevation, with only rodents showing a mid-elevational hump. The composition of rodent and bat communities differed significantly in upland versus lowland sites, but bat communities showed far more overlap across the elevational gradient. Functional diversity metrics responded differently for each taxon highlighting the importance of using different taxonomic groups when studying elevational patterns of functional diversity. Main Conclusions Our study shows that functional divergence increases with elevation in all three taxa, indicating a pervasive and broadly applicable strong environmental filtering at higher elevations. Our findings suggest that species at higher elevations may be at higher risk due to specialization. These species are losing habitat due to ongoing climate change that will force them up the elevational gradient. At the same time, the human population in Africa is predicted to triple in size by the year 2100, which will also likely contribute to further habitat loss and fragmentation. As small mammals often play essential roles in ecosystems, from seed dispersal to soil aeration and predation, understanding the susceptibility of the specialization of species at higher elevations is crucial for the effective conservation and management of mountain ecosystems, especially in light of climatic change and human expansion.","2024","2025-02-10 21:04:01","2025-02-10 21:04:01","2025-02-10 21:04:01","e13801","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 The Authors.

The goal of this study is to test whether geographic range size can be predicted by dispersal capacity among vespertilionid bats within a phylogenetic comparative framework. We integrated a large dataset on range area, longitudinal extent, wing morphology (a proxy for dispersal ability), migratory habit, and biogeographic realm across 126 vespertilionid bat species. We used phylogenetic regressions to disentangle the associations between these predictor factors and species range size while controlling for the effects of migration and biogeographic realm. Our analyses revealed that bat species with higher wing loading exhibit larger distribution ranges than those with lower wing loading, and that the size of geographic ranges was associated with wing aspect ratio in bats.

For example, the <italic>FoxP2</italic> gene, underpinning vocal behavior and sensorimotor coordination, has undergone diversification in bats, while several genes associated with audition show parallel amino acid substitutions in unrelated lineages of echolocating bats and, in some cases, in echolocating dolphins, representing a classic case of convergent molecular evolution. Vision genes encoding the photopigments rhodopsin and the long-wave sensitive opsin are functional in bats, while that encoding the short-wave sensitive opsin has lost functionality in rhinolophoid bats using high-duty cycle laryngeal echolocation, suggesting a sensory trade-off between investment in vision and echolocation. In terms of olfaction, bats appear to have a distinctive OR repertoire compared with other mammals, and a gene involved in signal transduction in the vomeronasal system has become non-functional in most bat species. Bitter taste receptors appear to have undergone a “birth-and death” evolution involving extensive gene duplication and loss, unlike genes coding for sweet and umami tastes that show conservation across most lineages but loss in vampire bats. Common vampire bats have also undergone adaptations for thermoperception, via alternative splicing resulting in the evolution of a novel heat-sensitive channel. The future for understanding the molecular basis of sensory biology is promising, with great potential for comparative genomic analyses, studies on gene regulation and expression, exploration of the role of alternative splicing in the generation of proteomic diversity, and linking genetic mechanisms to behavioral consequences.</p>","2013-05-30","2025-02-10 21:05:45","2025-02-10 21:05:45","2025-02-10 21:05:45","","","","4","","Front.

Bats also exhibit extreme longevity given their body size with many species showing few signs of ageing. The molecular basis of this extended longevity has recently attracted attention. Telomere maintenance potentially underpins bats’ extended healthspan, although functional studies are still required to validate the causative mechanisms. In this review, we detail the current knowledge on bat telomeres, telomerase expression, and how these relate to ecology, longevity and life-history strategies. Patterns of telomere shortening and telomerase expression vary across species, and comparative genomic analyses suggest that alternative telomere maintenance mechanisms evolved in the longest-lived bats.

This limited review left aside several aspects that deserve a great deal of attention, including: physiological impact of evolving a large, hairless flight membrane; impact of genomic approaches in understanding the evolution of gene systems that allow bat metabolic performance (e.g., Shen et al., 2010); implications of specific muscle physiology of bats and their ontogeny (e.g., Hermanson, 1998, 2000) in the transition to flight; correspondence between ontogeny of flight (e.g., Elangovan et al., 2004, 2007), proposed adaptive landscapes (Adams, 2000; 2008), and the sequence of morphological changes implied in current phylogenies; the possible connection between rapid growth of long bones (e.g., Farnum et al., 2008a, b) and precociality (e.g., Jepsen, 1970) with morphological changes in evolutionary time; a thorough analysis of aerodynamic models in light of previously unknown morphologies now available from new fossils; and a full-scale allometric analysis of structural change (e.g., of wing development; Kunz and Robson, 1995; Wyant and Adams, 2007) applied to interspecific variation in the phylogeny of bats.However, as summarized below, a substantial body of knowledge from numerous fields of bat biology exists, and the current challenge consists of elaborating a comprehensive synthesis of all such knowledge, perhaps starting from the oldest fossils, the Early Eocene bats. These bats exhibited a mosaic of derived (e.g., greatly elongated, foldable hand wing) versus primitive wing features (e.g., clawed digits with rigid bony phalanges), as well as embryonic retentions (e.g., hand webbing, supinated hand) versus divergences from the mammalian developmental standard (e.g., elongated digits). These character states changed rapidly during the course of early bat evolution, but left morphological signatures in fossils that allow an increasingly finer level of detail in reconstructing the transition experienced by bats as the only volant mammals. In this way, fossils reveal not only the morphology of extinct organisms but also the ontogenetic stages attained in diverse developing systems. For instance, the claws of Onychonycteris show that this taxon underwent the standard mammalian process of ungual phalanx development, whereas this process is arrested to varying degrees in more derived bats. In general, bats seem particularly useful in showing how paleontological and developmental evidence can be combined in ways that illuminate each other and the evolution of a lineage. Evolution of the hand wing is key in the transition to flapping flight. In this chapter, a cumulative sequence of four major events is proposed: interdigital membrane retention, digital elongation, wing folding, and truncation of distal phalanx development. In terms of developmental control, the first two processes, which are linked in bats, are understood at the molecular level (e.g., Hockman et al., 2008) and indicate that specific changes in spatiotemporal expression of regulatory genes played a major role in shaping the bat hand wing (as in derived limbs of other mammals; Honeycutt, 2008). The extraordinary rate of ontogenetic digital elongation reported for bats (Farnum et al., 2008a, b) may give clues about the question of Cooper and Tabin (2008) on how fast, and how intergraded, was the evolution of a novelty such as the bat hand wing. Pattern of expression of specific receptor proteins and signaling pathways may help explain the structure of C-MC joints, hence the origin of the complex wing folding mechanism of bats. In turn, a simple heterochronic process (e.g., deceleration) may account for the truncation of phalanx development. In spite of the evolution of the hand wing and flapping flight, the center of lift of the bat wing is in the plagiopatagium (Swartz et al., 2005) as in all gliders (Jackson and Schouten, in press). The plagiopatagium and the other patagial tracts likely evolved before the handwing and independently of each other. Each tract develops as a separate entity representing a distinct dermal appendage. These appendages appear to be already fully evolved in known fossils, so character states of the patagia, as well as hind-limb and some wing traits (e.g., C-MC-folding, faceting of scapular fossae), indicate that primitive bats were functionally as advanced as some of their modern descendants. However, primitive bats also exhibited functionally poor character states in wing proportions (e.g., relatively low AR), muscle attachments (e.g., ribs without laminae), and traits probably affecting aerodynamic performance (e.g., clawed, rigid finger tips). Fossils also show that, as compared to the wing, the hind-limb was more advanced toward the character states exhibited by modern bats, so bat precursors likely used hind-limb suspension before being fully capable of flapping flight (e.g., reconstructions in Smith, 1977).    In a gliding, or Darwinian, model of bat flight origin, the hypothetical transition sequence is from climbing and leaping to gliding to flapping. The first step is unproblematic as there are living representatives documenting the relative ease with which gliding has been achieved in independent clades of arboreal mammals. The transition to flapping flight has been questioned mainly because bats only seldom glide and gliders do not flap their aerofoils and differ in other aspects like their use of high angles of attack as compared to flying bats, all of which points to a wide performance gap in-between (see Bishop, 2008). However, bats are capable of gliding and, at low speed, they flap their wings at angles of attack typical of gliders. Therefore the transition envisioned by Scholey (1986a), Norberg (1986), Rayner (1986), and others, driven by improvements in cost of transport, is much less difficult than currently thought as long as 1. a performance gradient of increasing AR and decreasing WL is sustained in the evolving wing (see above); and 2. low-amplitude flapping is introduced later in the process, when the wing reaches an intermediate AR and a low WL. Interestingly, the onset of flapping in developing bats occurs when maximum AR and minimum WL combine favorably (Adams, 2008; Elangovan et al., 2004, 2007), so there could be a ontogenetic component correlated with evolving powered flight. AR and WL are oversimplified characters which may not describe bat flight with the necessary functional accuracy (Riskin et al., 2010; Swartz et al., 2005); still, these parameters allow depiction of a coarse-grained gradient of possible changes during the evolution of bat flight. The morphology of bats likely posed problems at the ecophysiological level, particularly the combination of being small-sized homeotherms with extensive, highly vascularized, hairless membranes. While these membranes may be greatly advantageous to dispose of waste heat during the nighttime (Pennycuick, 1986; Neuweiler, 2000), by the same principle of heat exchange bat precursors may have experienced problems of excessive heat loss during resting. Hind-limb suspension using a tendon-locking mechanism may have allowed bats to exploit tree cavities and take advantage of this energy-saving roost, as they do today in forests. Subsequent evolution of wing folding greatly improved control of heat loss at the roost, with additional advantages (e.g., wing protection). Other, somewhat contentious ecological aspects of bat evolution, particularly activity patterns and diet, are resolved by recourse to phylogenetic inertia given that nocturnality and insectivory are plesiomorphic in mammals so no change is required at the root of the chiropteran subtree.Hypothetical bat precursors are here envisioned as relatively small mammals with a forest-glider body plan but with naked membranes and some behavioral character states of manifest evolutionary inertia (insectivory, nocturnality), initially evolving hindlimb suspension and a tree-cavity dwelling habit, next rapidly evolving size (phyletic nanism), an elongated handwing, and a wing folding mechanism, initiating flapping at some low-speed situation such as breaking before landing, and continuing in a path of increasing AR and wing refinement (e.g., reduction of claws) that allowed an explosive adaptive radiation and invasion of all continents by the Early Eocene. Finally, if the gliding model is correct, the performance of just any gliding mammal would be enhanced by, for instance, wings evolving toward high AR. So why only bats among mammals developed flight when there are many independent gliding lineages, each of which represents a potential “source” of bat-like descendants? The answer probably is historical and lays on the nature of changes required to elaborate the bat hand wing. Cretekos et al. (2008) suggested that evolutionary changes like fore-limb elongation may require many changes in regulatory genes with minor or transient, but cumulative effect, which would produce sudden, large-scale modifications once combined in a bat ancestor. In addition, some of the regulatory effects that generate an elongated and webbed hand are intrinsically antagonistic if not for the rather elaborate patterning of expression in the handplate. For instance, an up-regulated Bmp2 is required to elongate the digits but its expression causes cell death in the interdigital tissue; so specific patterning and additional regulators are required to produce elongated digits and dactilopatagium (see Hockman et al., 2009); notice that a possible regulatory mechanism becomes evident for the colugo, with webbed autopods but short digits (e.g., similar to webbed aquatic birds; see Weatherbee et al., 2006). These effects, to be compatible overall, are orchestrated in ways that just do not favor chances of replication in other lineages, even those lineages that could be selected by these changes (e.g., other gliders). Moreover, those extraordinary transformations were not heavily penalized by selection probably because they did not happen in isolation; it is possible that pre-existing habits (e.g., hind-limb suspension and roosting in energy-saving cavities) and additional and timely adaptations (e.g., C-MC wing folding) enabled bat precursors to endure a seemingly difficult transition, ultimately crossing over from gliding to powered flight.","2012","2025-02-10 21:07:15","2025-02-10 21:07:15","2025-02-10 21:07:15","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","eng","info:eu-repo/semantics/restrictedAccess","","","","ri.conicet.gov.ar","","Accepted: 2022-01-27T12:49:17Z Publication Title: Evolutionary History of Bats: Fossils, Molecules and Morphology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As dispersal allows species to move and colonize new regions with distinct climates, the role of dispersal traits in determining the occupation of particular climatic conditions is hypothesized to be important in climatic niche determination. I test this hypothesis by investigating the effects of interspecific variation in bat dispersal abilities due to wing morphology on species climatic niches. For 74 phyllostomid bat species, I collected their niche positions (i.e. mean value of occupied climatic conditions) along the climatic space as defined by phylogenetic principal components, as well as wing variables related to flight performance and aerodynamics. To test how wing variables are related to species positions along climatic niche axes, I used a framework of phylogenetic regressions and model selection by information theory. I found that wing morphology has an important and positive influence on bat species niche positions in the climatic space. Species with increased relative wing loading have better flight performance which likely allowed them to overcome geographical barriers to dispersal in order to colonize areas with distinct climatic regimes, thus influencing their climatic niche configurations. My results reconcile the morphological role bat wings have on local habitat use with their effects on dispersal and their importance in shaping climatic niches at broad scales. Overall, my findings reinforce the roles of dispersal and complementary life-history traits in determining species climatic niches. These results imply that traits linked to tracking suitable habitats may be important for adapting to climate change.","2020","2025-02-10 21:07:25","2025-02-10 21:07:25","2025-02-10 21:07:25","239-247","","4","312","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 The Zoological Society of London","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jzo.12826","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\AZJIZGCB\Varzinczak - 2020 - Understanding the relationship between climatic niches and dispersal through the lens of bat wing mo.pdf","","","Phyllostomidae; Chiroptera; aspect ratio; climatic space; flight abilities; Hutchinsonian niche; niche position; relative wing loading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Chiroptera, a sensory trade-off has been proposed between the visual and auditory systems, though the extent of this association has yet to be fully examined. To investigate whether variation in visual performance is associated with echolocation, we experimentally assayed the dim-light visual pigment rhodopsin from bat species with differing echolocation abilities. While spectral tuning properties were similar among bats, we found that the rate of decay of their light-activated state was significantly slower in a nonecholocating bat relative to species that use distinct echolocation strategies, consistent with a sensory trade-off hypothesis. We also found that these rates of decay were remarkably slower compared with those of other mammals, likely indicating an adaptation to dim light. To examine whether functional changes in rhodopsin are associated with shifts in selection intensity upon bat Rh1 sequences, we implemented selection analyses using codon-based likelihood clade models. While no shifts in selection were identified in response to diverse echolocation abilities of bats, we detected a significant increase in the intensity of evolutionary constraint accompanying the diversification of Chiroptera. Taken together, this suggests that substitutions that modulate the stability of the light-activated rhodopsin state were likely maintained through intensified constraint after bats diversified, being finely tuned in response to novel sensory specializations. Our study demonstrates the power of combining experimental and computational approaches for investigating functional mechanisms underlying the evolution of complex sensory adaptations.","2018-10-01","2025-02-10 21:07:36","2025-02-10 21:07:36","2025-02-10 21:07:36","2422-2434","","10","35","","Molecular Biology and Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\2D5JHGY3\Gutierrez et al. - 2018 - Functional Shifts in Bat Dim-Light Visual Pigment Are Associated with Differing Echolocation Abiliti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most previous studies used proxies rather than actual climate and land-use data, and their interactions are rarely explored. We investigate whether higher summer average temperatures are driving decreasing bat body size as predicted by Bergmann's rule or increasing appendage size as per Allen's rule. We also explore whether temperature or resource availability (namely forest cover) is responsible for changes in wing functional traits. Using land-use data from historical maps and national statistics combined with climatic data, we assessed the effect of temperature and resource availability on bat morphology. We used 464 museum specimens of three bat species (Eptesicus nilssonii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus, and Plecotus auritus), spanning 180 years, across a 1200 km latitudinal gradient. We found no evidence of higher summer average temperatures driving decreases in body size in bats. Jaw sizes of P. auritus and P. pygmaeus changed over time but in different directions. The geographical variation of forest cover was also related to differences in wing functional traits in two species. Crucially, there was a significant antagonistic interactive effect of forest and temperature on tip index in P. pygmaeus whereby above 14.5°C the relationship between forest and tip index actually reversed. This could indicate that higher temperatures promote more pointed wings, which may provide energetic benefits. Our results show the importance of including both climatic and land-use variables when assessing trends in bat morphology and exploring interactions. Encouragingly, all three species have shown an ability to adapt their body size and functional traits to different conditions, and it could demonstrate their potential to overcome future negative impacts of climate and land-use change.","2023","2025-02-10 21:07:44","2025-02-10 21:07:44","2025-02-10 21:07:44","e9695","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 The Authors.

Given Neotropical bats' high diversity of feeding habits and flying abilities, and that they play multiple, important ecological roles in ecosystems, they are an ideal study system to address such a need. We investigated the effects of livestock ranching on Neotropical bat species and functional groups composition via meta-analyses of published information. We used the odds-ratio metric to compare the frequency of occurrence of bat species in old-growth forest vs. areas influenced by livestock. Our results show no effects when considering bats as a group. However, significant effects emerge when they are assessed separately, on the basis of taxonomic family, feeding habit, conservation status and flying ability, showing that considering bats as a black box mutes relevant patterns. Molossid and phyllostomid species with high movement ability or omnivorous habit showed an increased frequency in livestock areas. In contrast, frugivores and aerial insectivores with low movement ability, carnivores, gleaning insectivores, nectarivores, sanguivores and species considered under some degree of extinction risk were significantly more frequent in old-growth forest. Overall, our results support that areas converted for livestock production retain only a subset of the Neotropical bat functional diversity while most of the functional groups are negatively impacted. Such heterogeneity of responses seems critical for our understanding of the effects of land use change on animal communities.","2017-06-01","2025-02-10 21:07:53","2025-02-10 21:07:53","2025-02-10 21:07:53","343-348","","","210","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\EI46BUCL\S0006320717301301.html","","","Habitat loss; Land-use change; Conservation biogeography; Defaunation; Neotropical forest; Species loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The features previously used to link microbats and megabats have been examined and found to be questionable bases for support of a monophyletic origin. In particular, morphological analyses of the musculoskeletal adaptations associated with the flight apparatus are consistent with two separate origins of the mammalian wing. Taken together, these analyses suggest that megabats evolved from an early branch of the primate lineage. This branch was comprised of moderate-sized, phytophagous gliders, of which the other living descendants are the dermopterans.

Understanding how variation in functional traits is associated with species vulnerability in fragmented landscapes is central to the design of effective conservation strategies. Here, we used a whole-ecosystem ecological experiment in the Central Amazon to investigate which functional traits of aerial-hawking insectivorous bats best predict their sensitivity to forest fragmentation. During 2014, bats were surveyed using passive bat recorders in six continuous forest sites, eight forest fragments, eight fragment edges, and eight forest clearings. The interaction between functional traits, environmental characteristics, and species distribution was investigated using a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Our results showed that echolocation call structure, vertical stratification, and wing aspect ratio were the strongest predictors of sensitivity to forest fragmentation. Frequency of maximum energy, body mass, and relative wing loading did not show any correlation with the environmental variables. Bat species with constant-frequency calls were associated with high vegetation density, being more susceptible to forest fragmentation than species with frequency-modulated calls. Vertical stratum preference was also correlated with vegetation structure, indicating that understory species were more sensitive to forest loss than canopy species. Finally, species with high aspect ratio wings were linked to forest edges and clearings. Our findings suggest that species functional traits determine the vulnerability of aerial-hawking insectivorous bats toward fragmentation and, similarly, environmental conditions determine if a species is likely to become locally extinct due to fragmentation. Preserving structurally complex forests will be crucial to ensure the long-term persistence of the most sensitive and vulnerable species of this bat ensemble in fragmented landscapes across the Neotropics.</p>","2019-10-11","2025-02-10 21:08:39","2025-02-10 21:08:39","2025-02-10 21:08:39","","","","7","","Front.

Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of polytocy in chiropterans and use phylogenetically informed regressions to investigate its relationship to roost type, longevity and group size. Our phylogenetic reconstructions suggested that production of multiple offspring was the ancestral condition in family Vespertilionidae. The distribution of monotocy/polytocy in Chiroptera was best explained by a minimum of two evolutionary transitions from monotocy to polytocy and by ≥ 18 transitions from polytocy to monotocy. The regression models showed that longevity and roost type explained the variation in litter size, whereas group size did not. Our analyses also revealed a greater diversity of polytocous bats in the Northern Hemisphere, in both temperate and tropical regions. We suggest that the high resource allocation to reproduction in polytocous bats limited their lifespan. The absence of a relationship between polytocy and group size indicates that the benefits of cooperative breeding surpass the costs of intrasexual competition in bats.","2021-03-01","2025-02-10 21:08:48","2025-02-10 21:08:48","2025-02-10 21:08:48","676-684","","3","132","","Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\XW3G72AX\Garbino et al. - 2021 - Evolution of litter size in bats and its influence on longevity and roosting ecology.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This segregation was consistent with the assumption that laryngeal echolocation was acquired by a common ancestor and inherited by all microchiropterans. Thus, laryngeal echolocation was regarded to have evolved once. Recent advances in bat genome sequencing have added insights regarding the origin of bats and their phylogenetic relationships. The megabats previously thought to be phylogenetically isolated are now sharing a common ancestor with the superfamily Rhinolophoidea, which is constituted of laryngeal echolocators. This new relationship brings a counterpoint regarding the hypothesis of single origin of echolocation, which could have appeared several times independently. Concomitantly, recent studies in bat evolutionary developmental biology have illuminated the importance of characters from embryonic development to discussions of how and when echolocation evolved. Here, we describe how comparative chiropteran laryngeal morphology is a novel area of research that could improve the understanding of echolocation and may help resolve the evolutionary history of bats. This review provides morphological descriptions and comparisons of the larynx, bioacoustics interpretations, and newly developed visualisation approaches (i.e., contrast-enhanced computed tomography). We discuss the importance of understanding (1) laryngeal sound production so it may be linked with the evolution of the Chiropteran auditory system and (2) the evolution of laryngeal morphology to understand the ecological and behavioural aspects of bat biology.","2022-06-13","2025-02-10 21:09:13","2025-02-10 21:09:13","2025-02-10 21:09:13","","","","","","","The vocal apparatus of bats","","","","","","","en","CC-By Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International","","","","ecoevorxiv.org","","Publisher: EcoEvoRxiv","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\6J6VW79L\Brualla et al. - 2022 - The vocal apparatus of bats an understudied tool to reconstruct the evolutionary history of echoloc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a novel environment test to quantify personality in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and assess the short-term repeatability of a range of behaviours. We tested the hypothesis that development influences values of personality traits and predicted that trait values associated with activity would increase between newly volant, pre-weaning young-of-the-year (YOY) and more mature, self-sufficient YOY. We identified personality dimensions that were consistent with past studies of other taxa and found that these traits were repeatable over a 24-hour period. Consistent with our prediction, older YOY captured at a fall swarming site prior to hibernation had higher activity scores than younger YOY bats captured at a maternity colony, suggesting that personality traits vary as development progresses in YOY bats.

Different species in this family feed on blood, insects, vertebrates, nectar, pollen, and fruits. We investigated phylogenetic relationships among all genera of phyllostomid bats and tested monophyly of several genera (e.g., Micronycteris, Mimon, Artibeus, Vampyressa) using 150 morphological, karyological, and molecular characters. Results of parsimony analyses of these combined data indicate that all traditionally recognized phyllostomid subfamilies are monophyletic and that most taxa that share feeding specializations form clades. These results largely agree with studies that have used a taxonomic congruence approach to evaluate karyological, immunological, and limited sets of morphological characters, although our finding that Phyllostominae is monophyletic is novel. Our results indicate that several genera (Micronycteris, Artibeus, and Vampyressa) are not monophyletic. We propose a new classification for Phyllostomidae that better reflects hypothesized evolutionary relationships. Important features of this new classification include: (1) formal recognition of two clades that group nectarivorous and frugivorous subfamilies, respectively, (2) redefinition of Glossophaginae and recognition of two tribal-level taxa within that subfamily, (3) recognition of several tribal-level taxa in Phyllostominae, (4) formal recognition of two clades that have been colloquially referred to as “short-faced” and “long-faced” stenodermatines, (5) elevation of the subgenera of Micronycteris to generic rank, (6) recognition of Mesophylla as a junior synonym of Ectophylla, (7) recognition of Enchisthenes as a distinct genus, and (8) retention of Dermanura and Koopmania as subgenera of Artibeus. Although Vampyressa is not monophyletic in our tree, we recommend no nomenclatural change because we did not include all Vampyressa species in our study.Comparisons of character and taxonomic congruence approaches indicate that character congruence provides improved resolution of relationships among phyllostomids. Many data sets are informative only at limited hierarchical levels or in certain portions of the phyllostomid tree. Although both chromosomal and immunological data provide additional support for several clades that we identified, these data sets are incongruent with many aspects of our phylogenetic results. These conflicts may be due to methodological constraints associated with the use of karyological and immunological data (e.g., problems with assessing homologies and distinguishing primitive from derived traits). Among other observations, we find that Macrotus waterhousii, which has been thought to have the primitive karyotype for the family, nests well within the phyllostomine clade. This suggests that results of previous analyses of chromosomal data may need to be reevaluated.Mapping characters and behaviors on our phylogenetic tree provides a context for evaluating hypotheses of evolution in Phyllostomidae. Although previous studies of uterine evolution in phyllostomids and other mammals have generally supported the unidirectional progressive fusion hypothesis, our results indicate that intermediate stages of external uterine fusion are often derived relative to the fully simplex condition, and that reversals also occur with respect to internal uterine fusion. Uterine fusion therefore appears to be neither completely unidirectional nor progressive in Phyllostomidae.Evolution of the vibrissae and noseleaf is similarly complex and homoplasy is common in these structures; however, many transformations in these systems diagnose clades of phyllostomids. Within Phyllostomidae, there is considerable derived reduction in numbers of vibrissae present in various vibrissal clusters. The phyllostomid noseleaf seems to have become a much more elaborate and complex structure over evolutionary time.

Ecological traits were obtained from 20 bat species for a period of 2 years, and their relationship with measures of sensitivity to fragmentation was analyzed using Generalized Linear Models. The analysis suggests that naturally non-abundant species (e.g., Salvin's Big-eyed Bat [Chiroderma salvini]) have a greater risk of population decline because of habitat fragmentation. In contrast, abundant species such as Jamaican Fruit-eating Bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) will likely be less affected.

"NUBYU8SS","journalArticle","2000","Soriano, Pascual J","FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE OF BAT COMMUNITIES IN TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND ANDEAN CLOUD FORESTS","","","","","","The use of functional groups, such as trophic categories, is more useful for ecological interpretation of differences in community structure than the simple comparison of lists of names. Using these trophic categories demonstrates that bat assemblages from Andean cloud forests show greater taxonomic and functional simplicity than those from lowland rainforests. This altitudinal decrease has been interpreted as a consequence of the reduction of available resources. However, this is not manifested proportionally in all functional groups or trophic guilds or even in all taxa within the same guild. The insectivore guild seems to be directly responsible for the decrease, showing a high correlation with total bat species richness, while on the contrary, the rest of the functional categories decrease in other ways. Diet has a large influence on the metabolic rate of these mammals and therefore on their thermoregulatory capacities. Bats whose diet is based on protein (insects) in general have lower metabolic rates than those whose diet is comprised primarily of carbohydrates (fruit and nectar). In contrast to lowland forests where insectivores dominate bat communities, frugivores constitute the most important trophic category in cloud forests. I here postulate that the explanation for this difference in internal richness of these functional groups is found in the differential response capacities of each species to the thermoregulatory demands of the environment, which are directly related to their dietary regime. All these facts lead us to believe that the decrease of species richness with altitude is due to the inefficient thermoregulation of species of tropical origin, which make up most of the insectivore guild. Apparently, all insectivores of Neotropical origin have a «ceiling» in their vertical distribution which prevents them reaching the higher altitudinal belts, whereas the only bats reaching these high forests belong to the Vespertilionidae family of Neartic origin as well as a few representatives of the Molossidae.","2000","2025-02-10 21:10:05","2025-02-10 21:10:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\KDFKF5JV\Soriano - 2000 - FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE OF BAT COMMUNITIES IN TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND ANDEAN CLOUD FORESTS.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microchiropteran nectarivores share many characteristics with megachiropteran nectarivores and frugivores, but differ in having a long, narrow head. Megachiropterans have wide zygomata, which would allow for more jaw musculature. Diminutive cheekteeth are characteristic of nectarivory in both suborders, but both have relatively large canines. Teeth in nectarivores can occupy as little as a tenth of the palatal area compared to nearly two-thirds in microchiropteran animalivores. The proportion that the dilambdodont stylar shelf occupies of molars in microchiropteran nectarivores can be as much as that in microchiropteran animalivores (insectivorous and carnivorous bats) or as little as that in microchiropteran frugivores but not as extreme as either. In addition to dimunitive teeth, nectarivores have fused mandibles and upper canines that are worn from contact with the lower canines (thegosis). These characteristics may be necessary for the lower jaw to support an elongated, mobile tongue. While microchiropteran nectarivory, frugivory, and carnivory probably evolved independently from an insectivorous microchiropteran ancestor, megachiropteran nectarivory probably evolved from megachiropteran frugivory or the reverse.","1995-11-01","2025-02-10 21:10:13","2025-02-10 21:10:13","2025-02-10 21:10:13","439-463","","3","56","","Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we test predictions of the gliding-to-flying hypothesis of the origin of bat flight by using phylogenetic comparative methods to model the evolution of forelimb and hindlimb traits on a dataset spanning four extinct bats and 231 extant mammals with diverse locomotor modes. Our results reveal that gliders exhibit adaptive trait optima (1) toward relatively elongate forelimbs that are intermediate between those of bats and non-gliding arborealists, and (2) toward relatively narrower but not longer hindlimbs that are intermediate between those of non-gliders and bats. We propose an adaptive landscape based on limb length and width optimal trends derived from our modeling analyses. Our results support a hypothetical evolutionary pathway wherein glider-like postcranial morphology precedes a bat-like morphology adapted to powered-flight, setting a foundation for future developmental, biomechanical, and evolutionary research to test this idea.","2024-07-25","2025-02-10 21:10:24","2025-02-10 21:10:24","2025-02-10 21:10:24","e17824","","","12","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","peerj.com","","Publisher: PeerJ Inc.","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\UGCFBY5L\Burtner et al. - 2024 - Gliding toward an understanding of the origin of flight in bats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we standardize and synthesise the current data, assess the contribution of molecular research to the study of bat species and highlight the importance of its continued and expanded use. At an inter-population level, molecular studies have demonstrated a great diversity of population genetic structure within the order. Among populations of migratory species, genetic structure appears universally low, and hence seasonal movement is likely to be the prevailing influence. However, for sedentary species an array of factors including dispersal ability, extrinsic barriers to gene flow and historical events may determine the extent of genetic partitioning among populations. Intrinsic factors such as wing morphology or roost requirements may also influence population genetic structure in sedentary bat species, a proposal which requires further research. Molecular studies have also made important contributions towards an understanding of social organisation in bats. Evidence indicates that in many polygynous species male mating success does not translate directly into reproductive success, perhaps as a result of multiple mating by females. Estimates of relatedness within and genetic structure among colonies are, in general, very low; a finding which has important implications regarding theories concerning the formation and persistence of bat social groups. Molecular studies have provided new and important insights into the ecology of bats, and have opened up exciting and previously unexplored avenues of research. The data from these studies suggest not only a predictive framework for future studies, but also the use of genetic data in the management and conservation of bat species.","2001-08","2025-02-10 21:10:33","2025-02-10 21:10:33","2025-02-10 21:10:33","389-409","","3","76","","","Seeing in the dark","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","Chiroptera; gene flow; mating systems; molecular techniques; population structure; relatedness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through light-trapping, we collected moth specimens in different seasons and measured the morphological traits likely to affect their vulnerability to predation, such as body size and evasive flight capability. Our results showed that consumed moth prey diversity varies seasonally, with moths belonging to the Hepialidae family being preferred in the wet season. We found that the larger moth species with lower evasive capabilities are more vulnerable to predation. Sphingid and Hepialid moths, among the most abundant in the diet, have the lowest manoeuvrability and the maximum body size, respectively. By assessing vulnerability at the prey assemblage level, our study sets the stage for future research on moth–bat interactions from the diverse and less-explored Paleotropical communities.

From an insectivorous ancestor, species living today, over about 30 million years, have evolved a hyper-diverse range of diets, from blood or small vertebrates, to consuming nectar, pollen, and fruit. Phyllostomid plant-visiting species are responsible for pollinating more than five hundred species of neotropical shrubs, trees, vines, and epiphytes—many of which are economically and ecologically important—and they also disperse the seeds of at least another five hundred plant species. Fruit-eating and seed-dispersing members of this family thus play a crucial role in the regeneration of neotropical forests, and the fruit eaters are among the most abundant mammals in these habitats.  Coauthored by leading experts in the field and synthesizing the latest advances in molecular biology and ecological methods, Phyllostomid Bats is the first overview in more than forty years of the evolution of the many morphological, behavioral, physiological, and ecological adaptations in this family. Featuring abundant illustrations as well as details on the current conservation status of phyllostomid species, it is both a comprehensive reference for these ecologically vital creatures and a fascinating exploration of the evolutionary process of adaptive radiation.","2020-10-05","2025-02-10 21:12:09","2025-02-10 21:12:09","","","489","","","","","Phyllostomid Bats","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: l6L9DwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=l6L9DwAAQBAJ","","Science / General; Science / Life Sciences / Zoology / Mammals; Science / Life Sciences / Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because traits are genetically correlated, selection on a particular trait produces both direct effects on the distribution of that trait and indirect effects on other traits in the population. The correlations between traits can strongly impact evolutionary responses to selection and may thus impose constraints on adaptation. Here, we used museum specimens and comparative quantitative genetic approaches to investigate whether the covariation among cranial traits facilitated or constrained the response to selection during the major dietary transitions in one of the world’s most ecologically diverse mammalian families—the phyllostomid bats. We reconstructed the set of net selection gradients that would have acted on each cranial trait during the major transitions to feeding specializations and decomposed the selection responses into their direct and indirect components. We found that for all transitions, most traits capturing craniofacial length evolved toward adaptive directions owing to direct selection. Additionally, we showed instances of dietary transitions in which the complex interaction between the patterns of covariation among traits and the strength and direction of selection either constrained or facilitated evolution. Our work highlights the importance of considering the within-species covariation estimates to quantify evolvability and to disentangle the relative contribution of variational constraints versus selective causes for observed patterns.","2024-04","2025-02-10 21:12:17","2025-02-10 21:12:17","2025-02-10 21:12:17","E107-E127","","4","203","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","","","","macroevolution; comparative quantitative genetics; constraints; direct and indirect responses to selection; evolvability; net selection gradients","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we have assembled a new genome for a representative species of phyllostomid bat, the fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosis), and integrated it with eight published phyllostomid genomes, along with an additional 10 genomes of other bat species. Comparative genomic analysis across 10 200 orthologus genes has unveiled that those genes subject to divergent selection within the Phyllostomidae clade are notably enriched in metabolism-related pathways. Furthermore, we identified molecular signatures of divergent selection in the bitter receptor gene Tas2r1, as well as 14 genes involved in digesting key nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. In addition, our cell-based functional assays conducted on Tas2r1 showed a broader spectrum of perception for bitter compounds in phyllostomids compared to nonphyllostomid bats, suggesting functional diversification of bitter taste in Phyllostomidae. Together, our genomic and functional analyses lead us to propose that divergent selection of genes associated with taste, digestion and absorption, and metabolism assumes a pivotal role in steering the extreme dietary diversification in Phyllostomidae.

L.","The evolution of echolocation in bats: a comparative approach","","","","","https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1370574/","The evolutionary history of echolocation in bats is poorly understood, as fossils provide little direct evidence, and most studies into echolocation have taken an ecological approach. Bats use a wide variety of echolocation call structures despite facing similar sensory challenges, and it is not clear how and why these echolocation call types evolved, or what impact they have on other aspects of the evolution of bats. Here, I use phylogenetic comparative methods and newly-collated echolocation call data from 410 species in 120 genera and all 19 families to investigate the origination and evolution of echolocation in bats (Chiroptera). I construct an updated phylogenetic supertree of the bats using source phylogenies from the literature between 1970 and 2009. I ask three main questions: (1) Are echolocation call structures really a product of present-day ecological conditions, or are they much more constrained by evolutionary history than is currently thought? (2) What did the first echolocation calls sound like? (3) Are echolocation calls ‘key innovations’ that promote diversification? I found that early divergences and subsequent constraints in evolutionary history have resulted in a greater variety of bat call structures than appear to be functionally necessary. The structure of the first echolocation calls was predicted to be short duration, multi-harmonic, and narrowband, suggesting that the proto-bat was a slow and manoeuvrable flier with an opportunistic and omnivorous diet, and may have used a perch-hunting foraging strategy. Finally, some echolocation call types were found to correlate with higher diversification rates such that they may be considered key innovations, but, unexpectedly, the most rapidly diversifying clades were those in which species either did not use echolocation at all (Pteropodidae), or where less sensory reliance was placed on echolocation (Stenodermatinae: Phyllostomidae).","2012-11-28","2025-02-10 21:12:54","2025-02-10 21:12:54","2025-02-10 21:12:54","","433","","","","","The evolution of echolocation in bats","","","","","UCL (University College London)","","eng","open","Doctoral","","","discovery.ucl.ac.uk","","Pages: ?-?

Phyllostomid bats present highly diversified feeding habits associated with extensive cranial shape divergence. Biomechanical models predict that the cranial shape changes are linked to dietary variation through bite force. However, the relationship of cranial shape, diet and bite force had not been explicitly tested before. 2 Here we use a combination of geometric morphometric techniques and comparative methods to test for morphological correlates of bite force and diet in 14 phyllostomid bat species. Skull and mandible shape variation were assessed by vectors, derived from a two-block partial least squares analysis of geometric shape and size-independent bite forces. The relationship between bite force, skull shape and diet was assessed by phylogenetic generalized least square regressions. 3 Most variation in the bite force data examined here (approximately 74%) was explained by size variation alone, but the shape vectors for both skull and mandible explained a significant part of the residual variation in bite force (83% and 56%, respectively), as did the dietary differences (56%). Although the first principal component of diet variation is associated with a negative correlation between insectivory and frugivory, residual bite force and cranial shape are not associated with this diet contrast. Shape and residual bite force variation in the sample were strongly associated with the second diet component, depicting an increase in nectarivory. 4 Species with stronger bites (insectivorous and frugivorous) than expected for their sizes presented a shorter rostrum and mandible, higher skulls, and more developed muscle attachment areas. On the other hand, the characteristic cranial elongation of nectarivorous species (supporting the long tongue) is a trade-off with bite force. These morphological correlates of bite force are similar to those observed in carnivores and non-herbivorous marsupials, and can be related to morphological characters used in biomechanical models for bite force prediction. 5 Our results reinforce the effectiveness of statistically integrating geometric shape variables to bite force and diet information in the investigation of patterns of cranial shape change and trophic radiation in ecologically diverse vertebrate groups.","2009","2025-02-10 21:13:06","2025-02-10 21:13:06","2025-02-10 21:13:06","715-723","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2009 The Authors.

In mammals, the determinate growth of the skeleton entails that bite performance should change throughout ontogeny until the feeding apparatus attains its adult size and morphology. Then, interspecific differences in adult phenotypes are expected to drive food resource partitioning and patterns of lineage diversification. However, Formal tests of these predictions are lacking for the majority of mammal groups, and thus our understanding of mammalian ecomorphology remains incomplete. By focusing on a fundamental measure of feeding performance, bite force, and capitalizing on the extraordinary morphological and dietary diversity of bats, we discuss how the intersection of ontogenetic and macroevolutionary changes in feeding performance may impact ecological diversity in these mammals. We integrate data on cranial morphology and bite force gathered through longitudinal studies of captive animals and comparative studies of free-ranging individuals. We demonstrate that ontogenetic trajectories and evolutionary changes in bite force are highly dependent on changes in body and head size, and that bats exhibit dramatic, allometric increases in bite force during ontogeny. Interspecific variation in bite force is highly dependent on differences in cranial morphology and function, highlighting selection for ecological specialization. While more research is needed to determine how ontogenetic changes in size and bite force specifically impact food resource use and fitness in bats, interspecific diversity in cranial morphology and bite performance seem to closely match functional differences in diet. Altogether, these results suggest direct ecomorphological relationships at ontogenetic and macroevolutionary scales in bats.","2016-09-01","2025-02-10 21:13:15","2025-02-10 21:13:15","2025-02-10 21:13:15","459-468","","3","56","","Integrative and Comparative Biology","Extreme Postnatal Scaling in Bat Feeding Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\9PWIDSEJ\2363456.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Species richness, abundance and functional richness per night are positively related with forest cover. Generalized linear models show that species richness, abundance and functional richness per night are significantly related with forest cover, while seasonality had an effect on abundance and functional richness. Neither forest cover nor season had a significant effect on functional evenness. All these findings were consistent across three spatial scales (1, 3 and 5 km radius around sampling sites).

We use phyllostomid bats, the most diverse mammalian dietary radiation, to investigate if and how changes in dietary hardness and loading behaviors during feeding shaped the evolution of skull morphology and biomechanics. When selective regimes of food hardness are modeled, we found that species consuming harder foods have evolved skull shapes that allow for more efficient bite force production. These species have shorter skulls and a greater reliance on the temporalis muscle, both of which contribute to a higher mechanical advantage at an intermediate gape angle. The evolution of cranial morphology and biomechanics also appears to be related to loading behaviors. Evolutionary changes in skull shape and the relative role of the temporalis and masseter in generating bite force are correlated with changes in the use of torsional and bending loading behaviors. Functional equivalence appears to have evolved independently among three lineages of species that feed on liquids and are not obviously morphologically similar. These trends in cranial morphology and biomechanics provide insights into behavioral and ecological factors shaping the skull of a trophically diverse clade of mammals.","2012-08-01","2025-02-10 21:13:40","2025-02-10 21:13:40","2025-02-10 21:13:40","2587-2598","","8","66","","Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bats may persist in those environments, but the mechanisms responsible for their adaptability and the spatial scales in which the landscape imposes environmental filtering remain poorly studied in the Neotropics. We tested the hypothesis that landscape composition interacts with the spatial scale to affect the functional diversity of phyllostomids in an urban–rural gradient. Based on functional traits, we calculated indices of functional richness, divergence, evenness, and community-weighted means of morphological traits, and classified species into functional groups. We evaluated the changes in those variables in response to forest, grassland, and urbanized areas at 0.5, 1.25, and 2km scales. The number of functional groups, functional richness, and functional evenness tended to be higher in areas far from cities and with higher forest cover, whereas functional divergence increased in more urbanized areas. Our results show that the mean value of wing loading in the assemblage was negatively associated with landscape transformation at several spatial scales. However, environmental filtering driven by grass cover was particularly robust at the 0.5km scale, affecting big-sized species with long-pointed wings. Retaining natural forest in cattle ranging systems at 12 km2 appears to favor the functional evenness and number of functional groups of phyllostomids. Recognizing the scale of the effect on phyllostomid functional responses appears to be a fundamental issue for elucidating the spatial extent to which phyllostomid conservation planning in urban–rural landscapes should be addressed.

Bats show diverse skull shapes and are salient among mammals in their dramatic reorientation of major cranial features due to changes in the relative position of the rostrum with respect to the braincase (rostral flexion). Previous studies have suggested that rostral flexion evolved early in the history of bats in tandem with divergent echolocation modes. We directly quantified rostral flexion and integrated biomechanical modelling, morphometric, and comparative phylogenetic approaches to explore its functional and evolutionary consequences. We found that strong selection associated with echolocation mode explains the early evolution of rostral flexion in bats, with subsequent diversification at different rates within different echolocation emission types. We find extreme rostral flexion is associated with trade-offs in bite performance and overall evolutionary lability of cranial shape. The divergent evolution of rostral flexion across major bat lineages has thus been a major factor structuring the potential evolutionary pathways for the bat cranium. We further suggest that the early evolution of rostral flexion in bats biased the transitions to and from certain echolocation emission modes, and may have differentially affected the degree of dietary ecological diversification among bat clades.","2025-01-01","2025-02-10 21:14:02","2025-02-10 21:14:02","2025-02-10 21:14:02","blae123","","1","144","","Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","Macroevolutionary and biomechanical implications of rostral flexion in bat skulls","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bats might compete for key resources, and cases of exaggerated divergence of resource-related characters or trait overdispersion in bat assemblages are often explained in terms of current or past interspecific competition. However, other pressures leading to patterns that mimic the outcome of competition cannot always be ruled out. We present the state of knowledge on IC among bats, providing a critical evaluation of the information available and identifying open questions and challenges. We reviewed 100 documents addressing potential or actual IC in bats and categorised them in terms of the resource for which bats compete (food, foraging habitat, roosts, water, and acoustic space). We also examined the ecomorphological and behavioural traits considered therein to highlight responses to IC or niche partitioning. We found that: although resources should be limiting in order for competition to occur, this is seldom tested; sympatry is sometimes taken as synonymous of syntopy (yet sympatric species that are not syntopic will never experience competition); comparisons between sympatry and allopatry are rare; and testing of objective criteria exploring the existence of niche partitioning or character displacement is not commonly adopted. While morphological examination of food remains in droppings has often led to coarse-grained analysis that proved insufficient to establish the occurrence of food niche overlap or partitioning, new frontiers are being opened by state-of-the-art molecular dietary analysis. A better understanding of IC in bats is paramount, since distributional changes leading to novel bat assemblages driven by climate change are already taking place, and the dramatic decline in insect availability, as well as the global loss or alteration of foraging habitat, may generate new competitive interactions or exacerbate existing interactions in the Anthropocene, and into the future.","2020","2025-02-10 21:14:10","2025-02-10 21:14:10","2025-02-10 21:14:10","68-81","","1","50","","","Interspecific competition in bats","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mam.12180","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\CDSJQPUJ\Salinas-Ramos et al. - 2020 - Interspecific competition in bats state of knowledge and research challenges.pdf","","","climate change; global; bats; character displacement; interspecific competition; niche partitioning; resource","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we analyzed 20 Neotropical seed dispersal networks distributed from Mexico to southeastern Brazil to evaluate how relative abundance and functional traits influence bat species’ roles in seed dispersal networks. We tested how bat relative abundance and traits relate to species contribution to between-module (c metric) and within-module connectivity (z metric) and their position and potential to mediate indirect effects between species (betweenness centrality). Our results indicate that relative abundance is the main determinant of the role bats play in the networks, while traits such as aspect ratio show modest yet statistically significant importance in predicting specific roles. Moreover, all seed dispersal networks presented two or three superabundant obligatory frugivore species that interacted with a high number of plants. The modest influence of the functional traits on species’ roles is likely related to the low variation of morphological traits related to foraging ecology, which reduces the chances of morphological mismatching between consumers and resources in the system. In this scenario, abundant bats have higher chances of encountering resources and being capable of consuming them which leads such species to play critical roles in the community by acting as module hubs and network connectors.","2020-05-01","2025-02-10 21:18:07","2025-02-10 21:18:07","2025-02-10 21:18:07","189-198","","1","193","","Oecologia","Drivers of bat roles in Neotropical seed dispersal networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\9TKY9HSI\Laurindo et al. - 2020 - Drivers of bat roles in Neotropical seed dispersal networks abundance is more important than functi.pdf","","","Chiroptera; Neotropics; Frugivory; Morphological traits; Mutualistic interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report that, while disparity was established early, bat skull evolution is best described by multiple adaptive zone shifts. Shifts are partially decoupled between the cranium and mandible, with cranial evolution more strongly driven by echolocation than diet. Phyllostomidae, a trophic adaptive radiation, exhibits more adaptive zone shifts than all other families combined.

Variation partitioning has been used to broadly disentangle spatial and environmental mechanisms, and approaches utilizing functional and phylogenetic characteristics of communities have been implemented to determine the relative importance of particular environmental (or niche-based) mechanisms. Nonetheless, few studies have integrated these quantitative approaches to comprehensively assess the relative importance of particular structuring processes. Methods We employed a novel variation partitioning approach to evaluate the relative importance of particular spatial and environmental drivers of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic aspects of bat communities in a human-modified landscape in Costa Rica. Specifically, we estimated the amount of variation in species composition (taxonomic structure) and in two aspects of functional and phylogenetic structure (i.e., composition and dispersion) along a forest loss and fragmentation gradient that are uniquely explained by landscape characteristics (i.e., environment) or space to assess the importance of competing mechanisms. Results The unique effects of space on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic structure were consistently small. In contrast, landscape characteristics (i.e., environment) played an appreciable role in structuring bat communities. Spatially-structured landscape characteristics explained 84% of the variation in functional or phylogenetic dispersion, and the unique effects of landscape characteristics significantly explained 14% of the variation in species composition. Furthermore, variation in bat community structure was primarily due to differences in dispersion of species within functional or phylogenetic space along the gradient, rather than due to differences in functional or phylogenetic composition. Discussion Variation among bat communities was related to environmental mechanisms, especially niche-based (i.e., environmental) processes, rather than spatial mechanisms. High variation in functional or phylogenetic dispersion, as opposed to functional or phylogenetic composition, suggests that loss or gain of niche space is driving the progressive loss or gain of species with particular traits from communities along the human-modified gradient. Thus, environmental characteristics associated with landscape structure influence functional or phylogenetic aspects of bat communities by effectively altering the ways in which species partition niche space.","2016-10-13","2025-02-10 21:18:22","2025-02-10 21:18:22","2025-02-10 21:18:22","e2551","","","4","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","peerj.com","","Publisher: PeerJ Inc.","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\YJAWHZMB\Cisneros et al. - 2016 - Environmental and spatial drivers of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic characteristics of bat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most bat species use echolocation for navigation and foraging, but which and how ecological factors shaped echolocation call diversity remains unclear for the most diverse clades, including the adaptive radiation of neotropical leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae). This is because phyllostomids emit low-intensity echolocation calls and many inhabit dense forests, leading to low representation in acoustic surveys. We present a field-collected, echolocation call dataset spanning 35 species and all phyllostomid dietary guilds. We analyze these data under a phylogenetic framework to test the hypothesis that echolocation call design and parameters are specialized for the acoustic demands of different diets, and investigate the contributions of phylogeny and body size to echolocation call diversity. We further link call parameters to dietary ecology by contrasting minimum detectable prey size estimates (MDPSE) across species. We find phylogeny and body size explain a substantial proportion of echolocation call parameter diversity, but most species can be correctly assigned to taxonomic (61%) or functional (77%) dietary guilds based on call parameters. This suggests a degree of acoustic ecological specialization, albeit with interspecific similarities in call structure. Theoretical MDPSE are greatest for omnivores and smallest for insectivores. Omnivores significantly differ from other dietary guilds in MDPSE when phylogeny is not considered, but there are no differences among taxonomic dietary guilds within a phylogenetic context. Similarly, predators of non-mobile/non-evasive prey and predators of mobile/evasive prey differ in estimated MDPSE when phylogeny is not considered. Phyllostomid echolocation call structure may be primarily specialized for overcoming acoustic challenges of foraging in dense habitats, and then secondarily specialized for the detection of food items according to functional dietary guilds.

To investigate these relationships, we tested the fit of Brownian motion and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models of evolution in mechanical advantage and von Mises stress using dated multilocus phylogenies.

Teeth allow mammals to ingest and process food items by applying forces produced by a third-class lever system composed by the jaw adductors, the cranium, and the mandible. Physical laws determine changes in jaw adductor (biting) forces at different bite point locations along the mandible (outlever), thus, individual teeth are expected to experience different mechanical regimes during feeding. If the mammal dentition exhibits functional adaptations to mandible feeding biomechanics, then teeth are expected to have evolved to develop mechanically advantageous sizes, shapes, and positions. Here, we present bats as a model system to test this hypothesis and, more generally, for integrative studies of mammal dental diversity. We combine a field-collected dataset of bite forces along the tooth row with data on dental and mandible morphology across 30 bat species. We (1) describe, for the first time, bite force trends along the tooth row of bats; (2) use phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate relationships among bite force patterns, tooth, and mandible morphology; and (3) hypothesize how these biting mechanics patterns may relate to the developmental processes controlling tooth formation. We find that bite force variation along the tooth row is consistent with predictions from lever mechanics models, with most species having the greatest bite force at the first lower molar. The cross-sectional shape of the mandible body is strongly associated with the position of maximum bite force along the tooth row, likely reflecting mandibular adaptations to varying stress patterns among species. Further, dental dietary adaptations seem to be related to bite force variation along molariform teeth, with insectivorous species exhibiting greater bite force more anteriorly, narrower teeth and mandibles, and frugivores/omnivores showing greater bite force more posteriorly, wider teeth and mandibles. As these craniodental traits are linked through development, dietary specialization appears to have shaped intrinsic mechanisms controlling traits relevant to feeding performance.","2022-09-01","2025-02-10 21:20:12","2025-02-10 21:20:12","2025-02-10 21:20:12","762-773","","3","62","","Integrative and Comparative Biology","Bat Dentitions","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RM4BVLV4\Santana et al. - 2022 - Bat Dentitions A Model System for Studies at the Interface of Development, Biomechanics, and Evolut.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the phylogenetic structure in the integration space can be explained by splits at the beginning of the diversification of major clades. Our results provide evidence for a multiple peak adaptive landscape in the evolution of cranial covariance structure and morphological differentiation, based upon diet and roosting ecology. In this scenario, the successful radiation of phyllostomid bats was triggered by the diversification of dietary and roosting strategies, and the invasion of these new adaptive zones lead to changes in phenotypic covariance structure and average morphology. Our results suggest that intense natural selection preceded the invasion of these new adaptive zones and played a fundamental role in shaping cranial covariance structure and morphological differentiation in this hyperdiverse clade of mammals.

However, with respect to its cost per unit distance covered, powered flight is a very efficient mode of transport. Birds and bats are the only extant vertebrate taxa that have achieved flight. Phylogenetically different, they independently accomplished this elite mode of locomotion by employing diverse adaptive schemes and strategies. Integration of functional and structural parameters, a transaction that resulted in certain trade-offs and compromises, was used to overcome exacting constraints. Unique morphological, physiological and biochemical properties were initiated and refined to enhance the uptake, transfer and utilization of oxygen for high aerobic capacities. In bats, exquisite pulmonary structural parameters were combined with optimal haematological ones: a thin blood–gas barrier, a large pulmonary capillary blood volume and a remarkably extensive alveolar surface area in certain species developed in a remarkably large lung. These factors were augmented by, for example, exceptionally high venous haematocrits and haemoglobin concentrations. In birds, a particularly large respiratory surface area and a remarkably thin blood–gas (tissue) barrier developed in a small, rigid lung; a highly efficient cross-current system was fabricated within the parabronchi. The development of flight in only four animal taxa (among all the animal groups that have ever evolved; i.e. insects, the now-extinct pterosaurs, birds and bats) provides evidence for the enormous biophysical and energetic constraints that have stymied volancy. Bats improved a fundamentally mammalian lung to procure the large amounts of oxygen needed for flight. The lung/air sac system of birds is not therefore a prescriptive morphology for flight: the essence of its design can be found in the evolution of the reptilian lung, the immediate progenitor stock from which birds arose. The attainment of flight is a classic paradigm of the remarkable adaptability inherent in organismal and organic biology for countering selective pressures by initiating elegant morphologies and physiologies.","2000-10-15","2025-02-10 21:21:12","2025-02-10 21:21:12","2025-02-10 21:21:12","3045-3064","","20","203","","Journal of Experimental Biology","What it Takes to Fly","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\S3PSGMSY\Maina - 2000 - What it Takes to Fly The Structural and Functional Respiratory Refinements in Birds and Bats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morphological trait variation within species influences the energetic cost of locomotion and impacts life history traits, with ecological and evolutionary consequences. This study examined wing morphology correlates of flight performance measured by energetic expenditure in the Seba's short-tailed bat, Carollia perspicillata. In the flight experiments, nature caught bats (59 females, 57 males) were allowed to fly for 3 min in a room. After each flight, thermographic images were taken to measure body temperature, and biophysical models were used to calculate sensible heat loss as a measure of energetic expenditure. Wing morphological traits were measured for each individual and associated with heat loss and power required to fly on performance surfaces. Wing morphological traits explained 7–10% of flight energetic cost, and morphologies with the best performance would save the energy equivalent to 9–30% of total daily requirements. The optimal performance areas within the C. perspicillata morphospace were consistent with predicted selection trends from the literature. A trade-off between demands for flight speed and maneuverability was observed. Wing loading and camber presented sexual dimorphism. These morphological differences are likely associated with more economical but less maneuverable flight in females, leading them to fly more often in open areas along the forest edge. Our findings demonstrate how small scale changes in wing morphology can affect life history strategies and fitness.","2023","2025-02-10 21:21:48","2025-02-10 21:21:48","2025-02-10 21:21:48","876-890","","5","18","","","Flight performance and wing morphology in the bat Carollia perspicillata","","","","","","","en","© 2023 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1749-4877.12707","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\MK896DWC\Carneiro et al. - 2023 - Flight performance and wing morphology in the bat Carollia perspicillata biophysical models and ene.pdf","","","Phyllostomidae; Chiroptera; aerodynamics; infrared thermography; performance surfaces; wing morphometrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The penis morphology is diverse, presenting great potential for post-copulatory sexual selection and coevolution with the female morphology, but vaginas have not been carefully examined.

In view of the differences associated with their sensory systems, we decided to investigate the function and evolution of color vision (opsin genes) in these two suborders of bats. The middle/long wavelength (M/L) and short wavelength (S) opsin genes were sequenced from two frugivorous species of megabats, Haplonycteris fischeri and Pteropus dasymallus formosus, and one insectivorous species of microbat, Myotis velifer. Contrary to the situation in primates, where many nocturnal species have lost the functional S opsin gene, both crepuscular and strictly nocturnal species of bats that we examined have functional M/L and S opsin genes. Surprisingly, the S opsin in these bats may be sensitive to UV light, which is relatively more abundant at dawn and at dusk. The M/L opsin in these bats appears to be the L type, which is sensitive to red and may be helpful for identifying fruits among leaves or for other purposes. Most interestingly, H. fischeri has a recent duplication of the M/L opsin gene, representing to date the only known case of opsin gene duplication in non-primate mammals. Some of these observations are unexpected and may provide insights into the effect of nocturnal life on the evolution of opsin genes in mammals and the evolution of the life history traits of bats in general.","2004-02-01","2025-02-10 21:24:21","2025-02-10 21:24:21","2025-02-10 21:24:21","295-302","","2","21","","Molecular Biology and Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\TLZ29JXL\Wang et al. - 2004 - Molecular Evolution of Bat Color Vision Genes.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, phenotypic variability is characterized based on cranial morphology, with studies of other functionally important aspects of the phenotype, such as legs, feet and wings, being less frequent. We examined patterns of secondary sexual dimorphism and allometry of wing elements of the fringed fruit-eating bat (Artibeus fimbriatus) and examined, for the first time, the modularity of bat wings. Patterns were based on 13 wing measurements taken from 21 females and 15 males from eastern Paraguay. From a multivariate perspective, A. fimbriatus exhibited significant secondary sexual dimorphism. Females were larger than males for all 13 wing characteristics, with significant differences involving the last phalanx of the fourth and fifth digits. Female wings were also relatively larger than male wings from a multivariate perspective, as was the last phalanx of the fourth and fifth digits, after adjusting for wing size based on forearm length. Wing elements were highly variable regarding allometric relationships, with some exhibiting no allometric patterns and others exhibiting isometry or hyperallometry, depending on the element. Wings exhibited significant modularity, with metacarpals, proximal phalanges and distal phalanges each representing a discrete module. The wings of A. fimbriatus exhibit substantive patterns of dimorphism, allometry and modularity. Although the big mother hypothesis is a strong theoretical construct to explain wing dimorphism, there is not yet any sound theoretical basis for the patterns of allometry and modularity of the wing. Further investigation is required to understand the determinants of variation in wing morphology.","2022-12-01","2025-02-10 21:24:31","2025-02-10 21:24:31","2025-02-10 21:24:31","711-719","","4","137","","Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\ME384UBA\Stevens y Guest - 2022 - Wings of fringed fruit-eating bats (Artibeus fimbriatus) are highly integrated biological aerofoils.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review the evolutionary history of bats and eared insects, focusing on the insect order Lepidoptera, and consider the evidence for antipredator adaptations and predator counter-adaptations. Ears evolved in a remarkable number of body locations across insects, with the original selection pressure for ears differing between groups. Although cause and effect are difficult to determine, correlations between hearing and life history strategies in moths provide evidence for how these two variables influence each other. We consider life history variables such as size, sex, circadian and seasonal activity patterns, geographic range and the composition of sympatric bat communities. We also review hypotheses on the neural basis for anti-predator behaviours (such as evasive flight and sound production) in moths. It is assumed that these prey adaptations would select for counter-adaptations in predatory bats. We suggest two levels of support for classifying bat traits as counter-adaptations: traits that allow bats to eat more eared prey than expected based on their availability in the environment provide a low level of support for counter-adaptations, whereas traits that have no other plausible explanation for their origination and maintenance than capturing defended prey constitute a high level of support. Specific predator counter-adaptations include calling at frequencies outside the sensitivity range of most eared prey, changing the pattern and frequency of echolocation calls during prey pursuit, and quiet, or ‘stealth’, echolocation.","2016-06-01","2025-02-10 21:24:39","2025-02-10 21:24:39","2025-02-10 21:24:39","1589-1602","","11","219","","Journal of Experimental Biology","Evolutionary escalation","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\3FFJRTS5\ter Hofstede y Ratcliffe - 2016 - Evolutionary escalation the bat–moth arms race.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since deep genetic structure is often considered a precursor to speciation, identifying the factors that are associated with genetic structure can contribute to a greater understanding about diversification. Here, we use repurposed data to perform a global analysis of volant vertebrates (i.e., bats and birds) to estimate where intraspecific phylogeographic breaks occur and identify the factors that are important predictors of these breaks. We estimate phylogeographic breaks using Monmonier’s maximum difference barrier algorithm and conduct a Random Forests analysis using the presence of a phylogeographic break as a response variable. In bats, phylogeographic breaks are concentrated in biodiversity hotspots while breaks estimated in bird species are more widespread across temperate and tropical zones. However, for both clades geographical features such as maximum latitude, measures of wing morphology, and organismal traits associated with feeding ecology were found to be important predictors of phylogeographic breaks. Our analysis identifies geographical areas as wells as suites of organismal traits that could serve as a starting point for more detailed studies of biodiversity processes.","2024-02-12","2025-02-10 21:24:44","2025-02-10 21:24:44","2025-02-10 21:24:44","","","","","","","Bats of a feather","","","","","bioRxiv","","en","© 2024, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The morphology of the larynx is known to reflect vocal adaptation and thus can potentially help in resolving this controversy. However, the morphological variations of the larynx are poorly known in bats, and a complete anatomical study remains to be conducted. Here, we compare the 3D laryngeal morphology of 23 extant bat species of 11 different families reconstructed by using iodine contrast-enhanced X-ray microtomography techniques. We find that, contrary to previously thought, laryngeal muscle hypertrophy is not a characteristic of all bats and presents differential development. The larynges of Pteropodidae are morphologically similar to those of non-bat mammals. Two morphotypes are described among laryngeal echolocating bats, illustrating morphological differences between Rhinolophoidea and Yangochiroptera, with the main variations being the cricothyroid muscle volume and the shape of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. For the first time we detail functional specialization for constant frequency echolocation among Rhinolophoidea. Lastly, the nasal-emitting taxa representing a polyphyletic group do not share the same laryngeal form, which raises questions about the potential modular nature of the bat larynx.","2024-11-01","2025-02-10 21:24:57","2025-02-10 21:24:57","2025-02-10 21:24:57","zlad180","","3","202","","Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\QH8QCIPL\Brualla et al. - 2024 - Comparative anatomy of the vocal apparatus in bats and implications for the diversity of laryngeal e.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we provide a description of reproductive seasonality and length of reproductive activities such as gestation and lactation for Thyroptera tricolor, a small (3–4.5 g) Neotropical insectivorous bat and one of only four species in the family Thyropteridae. In addition, we also describe postnatal development, including growth rates and the onset of flight. Our results show that T. tricolor has long gestation (at least 3.5 months) and lactation (4 months) periods within a single annual reproductive event. Young are capable of sustained flight at two months of age, and attain adult forearm length at age 90 days and adult body mass at age 120 days. Offspring mortality was high, with 28% of young dying before age five months. Surviving young remained with their mother and natal group for at least one year. In addition, our field observations suggest that males attained sexual maturity earlier than females, at one year of age, while females became sexually active after their first year. These findings suggest that, among bats, T. tricolor may have an unusually slow life history, which could be attributed in part to its unique roosting ecology and social behavior.","2011-06-30","2025-02-10 21:25:05","2025-02-10 21:25:05","","147-155","","1","13","","Acta Chiropterologica","","","","","","","","","","","","","IngentaConnect","","","","","","","GESTATION; LACTATION; LIFE HISTORY; POST-NATAL GROWTH; REPRODUCTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bats of the genus Myotis include insectivorous, facultatively piscivorous, and piscivorous species. We tested the hypothesis that facultatively piscivorous (five Myotis species) and piscivorous species (M. vivesi) present cranial morphological and functional changes with respect to insectivorous taxa (16 Myotis species). Cranial shapes in skull and mandible modules were described with four geometric landmark configurations in these dietary groups. Gape capacity was measured with the stretch factors for temporal and masseter muscles. Geometric configurations from two skull and two mandible shapes were analyzed to detect differences in cranial morphology in relation to diet. Differences in cranial morphology were found between piscivorous and insectivorous species involving the mandibular process where masticatory muscles are attached. Linear regression analysis of Procrustes distances and gape capacity showed that the shape of the mandibular process region was highly correlated with the stretch factor of the masseter muscle in piscivorous and facultatively piscivorous species. These results suggest differences in cranial morphology and performance among diets but the hypothesis of gradual changes in cranial shape among diets was only accepted for the mandible and not for the skull. Myotis vivesi appears to improve mechanical advantage of masticatory muscles at lower gapes, presumably allowing more efficient chewing of slippery prey.","2016-06-30","2025-02-10 21:25:12","2025-02-10 21:25:12","","163-180","","1","18","","Acta Chiropterologica","Cranial shape and diet variation in Myotis species (Chiroptera","","","","","","","","","","","","IngentaConnect","","","","","","","GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS; MASTICATORY MUSCLES; MYOTIS; PISCIVORY; STRETCH FACTOR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When an innovative trait arises that confers a substantial advantage in terms of survival and reproduction, the evolution of adaptive complexes between such an innovation and other traits may constrain diversification of that lineage. The specialized echolocation system of the Rhinolophidae may represent such an innovation which affects other parts of the phenotype. We investigated a potential constraint on the diversity of phenotypes of several species of horseshoe bats within a phylogenetic framework. If phenotypic convergence stems from stasis as a result of the specialized echolocation system, phenotypes should converge not only among members of the same species and between sexes but also among species. We analyzed the phenotypic diversity of >800 individuals of 13–16 species. The phenotypes in the horseshoe bats did indeed converge. There was no sexual size dimorphism in mass, forearm length and wingspan within species and there was marked interspecific similarity in both wing and echolocation variables but marked variability in body mass. Furthermore, correlations of wing and echolocation variables with mass suggest that variability within horseshoe bats was largely the result of selection on body size with allometric responses in wing and echolocation parameters, a potential consequence of constraints imposed by their specialized echolocation.","2018-09","2025-02-10 21:25:19","2025-02-10 21:25:19","2025-02-10 21:25:19","85","","3","10","","","High Duty Cycle Echolocation May Constrain the Evolution of Diversity within Horseshoe Bats (Family","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\G6QY5DEK\Jacobs y Bastian - 2018 - High Duty Cycle Echolocation May Constrain the Evolution of Diversity within Horseshoe Bats (Family.pdf","","","body size; wing morphology; sexual dimorphism; PGLS; phylogenetic comparative method; Rensch’s rule","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has demonstrated a negative relationship between DI, measured as forearm asymmetry, and survival in the bat Carollia perspicillata. This study aims to test the hypothesis that individuals with higher DI exhibit a lower immune response. We measured a delayed-type hypersensitivity to the antigen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) on 74 males and 65 females of C. perspicillata before and after the breeding season (BS). Linear models were used to predict the immunological response based on body mass (BM), forearm asymmetry, sex, BS, and testicle length. The best-fitting model accounted for 29% of the variation in immune response and included asymmetry, BM, sex, and BS as predictors. The immune response was negatively associated with asymmetry and testicle length in males but positively related to asymmetry in females. Both sexes showed a reduced immune response in the late BS. Additionally, the association between immune response and BM changed direction seasonally, with heavier individuals showing weaker responses early in the BS and stronger responses later. Individual variation in male immunity was predicted by individual attributes, whereas variation in immune response in females was mostly seasonal. Our results support the link between DI, survival, and immune response in short-tailed bats, and suggest that the immunological component measured by the PHA response may be under finer selection in males due to its stronger correlation with individual traits.","2024-06-22","2025-02-10 21:25:40","2025-02-10 21:25:40","2025-02-10 21:25:40","zoae034","","","","","Current Zoology","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\52DAK5FG\Mellado et al. - 2024 - Developmental instability, body mass, and reproduction predict immunological response in short-taile.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This fuelled a spirited debate between proponents of the 'flight-first', 'echolocation-first' and 'tandem-development' hypotheses of bat evolution. New Green River bat fossils — including two near-complete skeletons, a cast of one of which is shown on the cover — looks to have settled the matter in favour of flight first. The new species is the most primitive bat known. It had fully developed wings and was clearly capable of powered flight, but the morphology of the ear region suggests that it could not echolocate, making it a possible intermediate link between bats and their non-flying, non-echolocating mammalian ancestors.

Bats are a species-rich, globally distributed group of organisms that are thought to be particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change because of their high surface-to-volume ratios and low reproductive rates. We systematically reviewed the literature on bat responses to climate change to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps and biases and highlight future research needs. We found that studies are geographically biased towards Europe, North America and Australia, and temperate and Mediterranean biomes, thus missing a substantial proportion of bat diversity and thermal responses. Less than half of the published studies provide concrete evidence for bat responses to climate change. For over a third of studied bat species, response evidence is only based on predictive species distribution models. Consequently, the most frequently reported responses involve range shifts (57% of species) and changes in patterns of species diversity (26%). Bats showed a variety of responses, including both positive (e.g. range expansion and population increase) and negative responses (range contraction and population decrease), although responses to extreme events were always negative or neutral. Spatial responses varied in their outcome and across families, with almost all taxonomic groups featuring both range expansions and contractions, while demographic responses were strongly biased towards negative outcomes, particularly among Pteropodidae and Molossidae. The commonly used correlative modelling approaches can be applied to many species, but do not provide mechanistic insight into behavioural, physiological, phenological or genetic responses. There was a paucity of experimental studies (26%), and only a small proportion of the 396 bat species covered in the examined studies were studied using long-term and/or experimental approaches (11%), even though they are more informative about the effects of climate change. We emphasise the need for more empirical studies to unravel the multifaceted nature of bats' responses to climate change and the need for standardised study designs that will enable synthesis and meta-analysis of the literature. Finally, we stress the importance of overcoming geographic and taxonomic disparities through strengthening research capacity in the Global South to provide a more comprehensive view of terrestrial biodiversity responses to climate change.","2023","2025-02-10 21:26:30","2025-02-10 21:26:30","2025-02-10 21:26:30","19-33","","1","98","","","Bat responses to climate change","","","","","","","en","© 2022 The Authors.

Therefore, it is integral to understand how species and assemblages will respond to this threat. Elevational gradients present a useful framework to measure potential changes to diversity due to climate change and human land use. Most studies focus on taxonomic diversity, and ignore functional diversity which provides a measure of the ecological roles of species within ecosystems. The aim of this study was to investigate taxonomic and functional diversity of as well as variation in assemblage structure of the insectivorous bat communities along the Mount Nimba elevational gradient. We predicted that both taxonomic and functional diversity would be negatively correlated with elevation, and that bat assemblages would show a nested pattern along the elevational gradient. Taxonomic diversity was calculated using species richness. Functional diversity of univariate and multivariate traits was calculated using two diversity indices: mean pairwise distance and mean nearest taxon distance. As predicted, species richness of bats was significantly negatively correlated with elevation. Functional diversity however, decreased significantly only at the highest elevation (and this may even be a sampling artifact given high human activities there in recent times). Contrary to predictions, metacommunity analyses revealed quasi-Gleasonian structuring of bat assemblages, indicating weak structuring forces along the elevational gradient. These results suggest that bat assemblages shifting in response to climate change along elevational gradients may change taxonomically but stay largely intact functionally.","2017-12-30","2025-02-10 21:26:36","2025-02-10 21:26:36","","273-285","","2","19","","Acta Chiropterologica","","","","","","","","","","","","","IngentaConnect","","","","","","","CHIROPTERA; ELEVATIONAL GRADIENT; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; METACOMMUNITY; MOUNT NIMBA; SPECIES RICHNESS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Almost 150 years ago, an unusual fleshy structure on the chest was discovered in an adult male little white-shouldered bat, Ametrida centurio, specimen stored in the collection of the British Museum (London). In addition to sexual differences in body size in this species, males also had swollen pads below their eyes. Here we show that there are other important sexually dimorphic traits that previously were not found in museum specimens, reinforcing how important complementary observations of live animals are for discovering traits that have been unnoticed for centuries. We report two new, unusual, presumably—but still not confirmed—glandular structures in male A. centurio, hereafter referred to as axillary and genital traits. The axillary structure is a hairless, reddened and moist area located beneath each wing, observed when wings are elevated. The genital structure surrounds the penis and coats the scrotal area and adjacent fur with a thick secretion.

The nature, development, function, and variation of these male traits remain unknown.

In particular, the subfamily Stenodermatinae has high morphological diversification associated with cranial and mandibular traits that are associated with the ability to consume the full range of available fruits (soft and hard). We analyzed craniodental traits and their relationship to the bite force in 343 specimens distributed in seven species of stenodermatine bats with two foraging strategies: nomadic and sedentary frugivory. We evaluated 19 traits related to feeding and bite force in live animals by correcting bite force with body size. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) and post hoc tests to determine possible relationships and differences between cranial traits, species, and sex. We also used Blomberg's K to measure the phylogenetic signal and phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS) to ensure the phylogenetic independence of the traits. We found that smaller nomadic species, A. anderseni and A. phaeotis , have a similar bite force to the large species A. planirostris and A. lituratus; furthermore, P. helleri registered a bite force similar to that of the sedentary bat, S. giannae. Our study determined that all the features of the mandible and most of the traits of the skull have a low phylogenetic signal. Through the PGLS, we found that the diet and several cranial features (mandibular toothrow length, dentary length, braincase breadth, mastoid breadth, greatest length of skull, condylo-incisive length, and condylo-canine length) determined bite force performance among Stenodermatiane. Our results reinforce that skull size is a determining factor in the bite force, but also emphasize the importance of its relationships with morphology, ecology, and phylogeny of the species, which gives us a better understanding of the evolutionary adaptions of this highly diverse Neotropical bat group.","2021","2025-02-10 21:27:39","2025-02-10 21:27:39","2025-02-10 21:27:39","13756-13772","","20","11","","","Foraging strategies, craniodental traits, and interaction in the bite force of Neotropical frugivorous bats (Phyllostomidae","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Authors.

Here, we test these previous hypotheses of bat body size evolution using a large, comprehensive supermatrix phylogeny (+800 taxa) to optimize body size and examine changes reconstructed along branches. Our analysis provides evidence of rapid stem phyletic nanism, an ancestral value stabilized at 12 g for crown-clade Chiroptera followed by backbone stasis, low-magnitude changes inside established families, and massive body size increase at accelerated rate in pteropodid subclades. Total variation amount explained by pteropodid subclades was 86.3%, with most changes reconstructed as phyletic increases but also apomorphic decreases. We evaluate these macroevolutionary patterns in light of the constraints hypothesis, and in terms of both neutral and adaptive evolutionary models.

The wings of bats are complex structures made of membranes, muscles, tendons, cartilages, bones, and joints. Forelimb bones are critical elements of wings because they form an essential part of the alar mass, serve to support soft tissue, and resist deformations. Only a few studies have attempted to detect relationships between morphology and ecology of the forelimb bones in bats in an assemblage context. Here, we explored ecomorphological patterns of 180 specimens belonging to 22 genera and 37 species of four families, occurring in northern Argentina. We quantitatively characterized bones and analyzed their relation with wing shape, as described by aerodynamic parameters, and ecological habits in a phylogenetic context. For the analyses, we used eight ecological categories, five wing variables that included three aerodynamic indexes, 29 linear measurements of the bones (humerus, radius, and scapula), and lengths of digits III and V. As expected, specimens distribution in morphospace showed that species tend to be segregated on the basis of size and morphology. Interestingly, Molossidae and Lasiurini occupy nearby areas in the morphospace, which can reveal patterns of functional convergences between them. A significant correlation between wing shape and morphology of forelimb bones was detected, showing a link between the latter and aerodynamic variables. We observed a remarkable morphological variation in the structures of the proximal and distal ends of the humerus, the proximal end of the radius, and in the acromion of the scapula. Our results highlight that these variations reflect the degrees of specialization in different modes of flight and ecological habits. We also observed that phylogeny explained in part the morphological patterns and shows a strong covariation with ecological habits, finding different phylogenetic patterns among the main lineages (Molossidae, Vespertilionidae, and Phyllostomidae).","2021-03-01","2025-02-10 21:28:08","2025-02-10 21:28:08","2025-02-10 21:28:08","99-110","","1","28","","J Mammal Evol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\C43LCUL9\Sánchez y Carrizo - 2021 - Forelimb Bone Morphology and its Association with Foraging Ecology in Four Families of Neotropical B.pdf","","","Phylogeny; Aerodynamic parameters; Ecomorphology; Morphofunctional patterns; Wing shape","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Long-term studies of a Panamanian fig community have revealed that the figs separate into two major groups based on distinct patterns in fruit characteristics including fruit size, colour, scent and synchrony of ripening. Furthermore, these differences can be linked to sensory, morphological and behavioural capabilities of the figs' primary dispersers. One group of figs attracts primarily bats; the other group is visited mainly by birds. Whereas fruits of ‘bat’ figs span a wide range of size classes, ripen synchronously and remain green(ish) when ripe, all fruits of ‘bird’ figs have small fruit which ripen asynchronously and turn red when ripe. Among ‘bat’ figs, fruit size is correlated with body size of the bats that prefer them. Based on the consistent differences between ‘bat’ and ‘bird’ fig fruits in Panama we expect similar patterns in Old World figs. Furthermore, since fig-eating bats of the Old World differ in morphology, behaviour and sensory capabilities from fig-eating bats of the New World we speculate that these differences should be reflected in differences in fruit characteristics of Old and New World ‘bat’ figs. Personal observations and literature reports of Old World bats and figs are consistent with our predictions.","1996","2025-02-10 21:28:17","2025-02-10 21:28:17","2025-02-10 21:28:17","565-576","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2699.1996.tb00018.x","","","","","birds; Bats; echolocation; foraging; Ficus fruit characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is in contrast to a single most parsimonious but poorly supported tree based on morphological data, which has only one intergeneric or higher relationship shared with the molecular phylogeny. Combining the morphological and molecular data partitions results in a tree similar to the molecular tree suggesting a high degree of homoplasy and low phylogenetic signal in the morphological data set. Behavioral data are largely incomplete and likewise produce a poorly resolved tree. Nonetheless, patterns of evolution in morphology and behavior can be investigated by using the molecular tree as a phylogenetic framework. Character optimization of the appearance of dorsal fur and preferred roosting sites maps consistently and are correlated on the phylogeny. This suggests an association of camouflage for bats with unusual appearance (two dorsal stripes in Rhynchonycteris and Saccopteryx, or pale fur in Cyttarops and Diclidurus) and roosting in exposed sites (tree trunks or under palm leaves). In contrast, the ancestral states for Old and New World emballonurids are typically uniform brown or black, and they usually roost in sheltered roosts such as caves and tree hollows. Emballonuridae is the only family of bats that has a sac-like structure in the wing propatagium, which is found in four New World genera. Mapping the wing sac character states onto the phylogeny indicates that wing sacs evolved independently within each genus and that there may be a phylogenetic predisposition for this structure. Ear orientation maps relatively consistently on the molecular phylogeny and is correlated to echolocation call parameters and foraging behavior, suggesting a phylogenetic basis for these character systems.","2008-06-01","2025-02-10 21:28:24","2025-02-10 21:28:24","2025-02-10 21:28:24","79-121","","2","15","","J Mammal Evol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\KIQBL6RQ\Lim y Dunlop - 2008 - Evolutionary Patterns of Morphology and Behavior as Inferred from a Molecular Phylogeny of New World.pdf","","","Phylogenetics; Morphology; Behavior; Emballonuridae; Nucleotide sequences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The role of animals in producing and responding to successional change has received far less attention. Dispersal of plant propagules by animals is a fundamental part of successional change in the tropics. Here we review the role played by frugivorous bats in successional change in tropical forests. We explore the similarities and differences of this ecological service provided by New and Old World seed-dispersing bats and conclude with a discussion of their current economic and conservation implications. Our review suggests that frugivorous New World phyllostomid bats play a more important role in early plant succession than their Old World pteropodid counterparts. We propose that phyllostomid bats have shared a long evolutionary history with small-seeded early successional shrubs and treelets while pteropodid bats are principally dispersers of the seeds of later successional canopy fruits. When species of figs (Ficus) are involved in the early stages of primary succession (e.g. in the river meander system in Amazonia and on Krakatau, Indonesia), both groups of bats are important contributors of propagules. Because they disperse and sometimes pollinate canopy trees, pteropodid bats have a considerable impact on the economic value of Old World tropical forests; phyllostomid bats appear to make a more modest direct contribution to the economic value of New World tropical forests. Nonetheless, because they critically influence forest regeneration, phyllostomid bats make an important indirect contribution to the economic value of these forests. Overall, fruit-eating bats play important roles in forest regeneration throughout the tropics, making their conservation highly desirable.","2007","2025-02-10 21:28:43","2025-02-10 21:28:43","2025-02-10 21:28:43","573-590","","4","82","","","","","","","","","","en","2007 Cambridge Philosophical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00026.x","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\DQE6UJ9T\Muscarella y Fleming - 2007 - The Role of Frugivorous Bats in Tropical Forest Succession.pdf","","","Phyllostomidae; frugivory; seed dispersal; Pteropodidae; tropical succession","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have focused on how specific aspects of dental morphology relate to diet. Here we use a comprehensive approach to describe 3D dental topography through a measure called dental complexity. Using phyllostomids as a model system, we investigate the functional significance of molar complexity with respect to prey breakdown of insect-eating species. We generated complexity data from 3D laser scans of molars from 17 species. We quantified feeding performance (ability to break down insects) and behaviour (number of chews) by conducting feeding experiments on 11 species using native prey. 3. Frugivores were found to have the highest molar complexity, which is related to biting into and crushing fruit pulp. Lower complexity of insectivore and omnivore molars can be related to the presence of crests specialized for shearing insect exoskeleton. Increases in the complexity of these shearing teeth translated into higher performance in prey breakdown (smaller exoskeleton particles), but chewing behaviour also played an important functional role. 4. Our results highlight the importance of morphology and behaviour in determining feeding performance, which potentially contributes to resource partitioning within this diverse group of mammals.","2011","2025-02-10 21:28:50","2025-02-10 21:28:50","2025-02-10 21:28:50","839-847","","4","25","","","The better to eat you with","","","","","","","en","© 2011 The Authors.

To date, the relative contribution of these factors to acoustic diversity is unclear in most vertebrate groups. Bats constitute one of the most speciose and diverse mammal groups, and most bat species rely on vocalizations for orientation, foraging, and communication. Here, we examine echolocation calls of 207 bat species across 17 families to weigh the relative role of phylogenetic inertia, natural selection, and morphological constraints in shaping echolocation call diversity in bats. Using the large dataset, we confirm that foraging guilds, phylogenetic relationships, and forearm length account for the majority of the variation in call parameters among bats. Foraging guilds play a major role in influencing call parameters in low duty cycle bats. At the family level, the variation in call parameters is primarily explained by differences in body size and phylogenetic relationships. Path analyses indicate that phylogeny determines call output not only by their direct effect on call parameters but also by having an indirect effect via foraging guilds and body size. These results demonstrate that natural selection, phylogenetic constraint, and morphological constraint shape echolocation call divergence in bats. Our findings underscore the importance of both adaptive and non-adaptive mechanisms underlying the evolution of echolocation calls in bats.","2019-11-21","2025-02-10 21:28:56","2025-02-10 21:28:56","2025-02-10 21:28:56","154","","11","73","","Behav Ecol Sociobiol","Echolocation call divergence in bats","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\N3MKFTV7\Luo et al. - 2019 - Echolocation call divergence in bats a comparative analysis.pdf","","","Chiroptera; Ecology; Evolution; Phylogeny; Acoustic signal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent analyses of cranial structure,feeding behavior and bite force across a wide range of bats suggest that correlations between morphology and performance and/or ecology are not as clearcut as previously thought. For example, most of the variation in bite force across a wide range of phyllostomid bats was explained by differences in body size rather than specific cranial traits. However, remarkably little is known about the muscular components that are responsible for generating the actual bite forces. We have tested which aspects of the cranial muscular system are good predictors of bite force across a wide range of species using a modeling approach. Model calculations of bite force show good correspondence with in vivo data suggesting that they can be used to estimate performance of the cranial system. Moreover, our data show that bite force is strikingly well explained by differences in temporalis muscle mass, temporalis fiber length and masseter muscle mass. Moreover, our data show that evolutionary changes in bite force capacity in bats are associated with evolutionary changes in relative m. temporalis mass and absolute skull length.","2008-01-01","2025-02-10 21:29:03","2025-02-10 21:29:03","2025-02-10 21:29:03","86-91","","1","211","","Journal of Experimental Biology","Morphological and mechanical determinants of bite force in bats","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\PU4I7SI8\Herrel et al. - 2008 - Morphological and mechanical determinants of bite force in bats do muscles matter.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In mammals, theoretical analyses and empirical studies suggest a trade-off between maximum bite force and gape at behavioural and evolutionary scales; in vivo bite force is expected to decrease at wide gapes, and cranial morphologies that enable high mechanical advantage are thought to have a lower ability to generate high bite forces at wide gapes, and vice versa. However, very few studies have confirmed these relationships in free-ranging mammals. This study uses an ecologically diverse sample of bats to document the variation in bite force with respect to gape angle, and applies three-dimensional models of the feeding apparatus to identify the major morphological and biomechanical predictors of the gape-bite force relationship. In vivo and model data corroborated that bite force decreases significantly at wide gapes across species, but there is substantial intraspecific variation in the data obtained from live bats. Results from biomechanical models, analysed within a phylogenetic framework, revealed that species with larger temporalis muscles, higher temporalis stretch factors and high mechanical advantages experience a steeper reduction in bite force with increasing gape. These trends are illustrated by short-faced durophagous frugivores. The results from this study suggest that gape-mediated changes in bite force can be explained both by behavioural effects and cranial morphology, and that these links are relevant for functional analyses of mammal dietary ecology.","2016","2025-02-10 21:29:33","2025-02-10 21:29:33","2025-02-10 21:29:33","557-565","","4","30","","","Quantifying the effect of gape and morphology on bite force","","","","","","","en","© 2015 The Author.

Low-duty-cycle bats operate with search phase cycles of usually less than 20 %. They process echoes in the time domain and are therefore intolerant of pulse–echo overlap. High-duty-cycle (&gt;30 %) species use Doppler shift compensation, and they separate pulse and echo in the frequency domain. Call frequency scales negatively with body mass in at least five bat families. Pulse duration scales positively with mass in low-duty-cycle quasi-constant-frequency (QCF) species because the large aerial-hawking species that emit these signals fly fast in open habitats. They therefore detect distant targets and experience pulse–echo overlap later than do smaller bats. Pulse duration also scales positively with mass in the Hipposideridae, which show at least partial Doppler shift compensation. Pulse repetition rate corresponds closely with wingbeat frequency in QCF bat species that fly relatively slowly. Larger, fast-flying species often skip pulses when detecting distant targets. There is probably a trade-off between call intensity and repetition rate because ‘whispering’ bats (and hipposiderids) produce several calls per predicted wingbeat and because batches of calls are emitted per wingbeat during terminal buzzes. Severe atmospheric attenuation at high frequencies limits the range of high-frequency calls. Low-duty-cycle bats that call at high frequencies must therefore use short pulses to avoid pulse–echo overlap. Rhinolophids escape this constraint by Doppler shift compensation and, importantly, can exploit advantages associated with the emission of both high-frequency and long-duration calls. Low frequencies are unsuited for the detection of small prey, and low repetition rates may limit prey detection rates. Echolocation parameters may therefore constrain maximum body size in aerial-hawking bats.","1999-12-01","2025-02-10 21:29:39","2025-02-10 21:29:39","2025-02-10 21:29:39","3359-3367","","23","202","","Journal of Experimental Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RFQRYZAA\Jones - 1999 - Scaling of echolocation call parameters in bats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we disentangle the direct and indirect effects of abiotic drivers (climatic conditions, and land use) and biotic drivers (vegetation structure and food resources) on functional diversity and composition of bird and bat assemblages along a tropical elevational gradient. Location Southern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, East Africa. Methods We counted birds and recorded bat sonotypes on 58 plots distributed in near-natural and anthropogenically modified habitats from 700 to 4,600 m above sea level. For the recorded taxa, we compiled functional traits related to movement, foraging and body size from museum specimens and databases. Further, we recorded mean annual temperature, precipitation, vegetation complexity as well as the number of fruits, flowers, and insect biomass as measures of resource availability on each study site. Results Using path analyses, we found similar responses of bird and bat functional diversity to the variation in abiotic and biotic drivers along the elevational gradient. In contrast, the functional composition of both taxa showed distinct responses to abiotic and biotic drivers. For both groups, direct temperature effects were most important, followed by resource availability, precipitation and vegetation complexity. Main Conclusions Our findings indicate that physiological and metabolic constraints imposed by temperature and resource availability determine the functional diversity of bird and bat assemblages, whereas the composition of individual functional traits is driven by taxon-specific processes. Our study illustrates that distinct filtering mechanisms can result in similar patterns of functional diversity along broad environmental gradients. Such differences need to be taken into account when it comes to conserving the functional diversity of flying vertebrates on tropical mountains.","2021","2025-02-10 21:29:57","2025-02-10 21:29:57","2025-02-10 21:29:57","2344-2356","","12","27","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Authors.

Delineation of seasonal limits in the reproductive calendar for threatened mammals can inform conservation efforts by clarifying parameters used in population viability models, as well as elucidate understanding of the mechanisms underpinning pathogen persistence in host populations. Here, we define the seasonal limits of a staggered annual birth pulse across the three species of endemic Madagascar fruit bat, known reservoirs for viruses of high zoonotic potential. Our field studies indicate that this annual birth pulse takes place in September/October for P. rufus, November for E. dupreanum, and December for R. madagascariensis in central-eastern Madagascar where the bulk of our research was concentrated. Juvenile development periods vary across the three Malagasy pteropodids, resulting in near-synchronous weaning of pups for all species in late January–February at the height of the fruiting season for this region. We here document the size range in morphological traits for the three Malagasy fruit bat species, with P. rufus and E. dupreanum among the larger of pteropodids globally and R. madagascariensis among the smaller. All three species demonstrate subtle sexual dimorphism with males being larger than females. We explore seasonal variation in adult body condition by comparing observed body mass with body mass predicted by forearm length, demonstrating that pregnant females add weight during staggered gestation periods and males lose weight during the nutritionally deficit Malagasy winter. Finally, we quantify forearm, tibia, and ear length growth rates in juvenile bats, demonstrating both faster growth and more protracted development times for P. rufus as compared with E. dupreanum and R. madagascariensis. The longer development period for the already-threatened P. rufus further undermines the conservation status of this species as human hunting is particularly detrimental to population viability during reproductive periods. Our work highlights the importance of longitudinal field studies in collecting critical data for mammalian conservation efforts and human public health alike.","2022-12-01","2025-02-10 21:30:04","2025-02-10 21:30:04","2025-02-10 21:30:04","1397-1408","","6","103","","Journal of Mammalogy","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\CT3CTXFL\Andrianiaina et al. - 2022 - Reproduction, seasonal morphology, and juvenile growth in three Malagasy fruit bats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the relative influence of these two deterministic filters on the phenotypic structure of insectivorous bat ensembles in southern Africa. We used null models to simulate the random phenotypic patterns expected in the absence of competition or prey defences and analysed the deviations of the observed phenotypic pattern from these expected random patterns. The phenotypic structure at local scales exhibited non-random patterns consistent with both competition and prey defense hypotheses. There was evidence that competition influenced body size distribution across ensembles. Competition also influenced wing and echolocation patterns in ensembles and in functional foraging groups with high species richness or abundance. At the same time, prey defense filters influenced echolocation patterns in two species-poor ensembles. Non-random patterns remained evident even after we removed the influence of body size from wing morphology and echolocation parameters taking phylogeny into account. However, abiotic filters such as geographic distribution ranges of small and large-bodied species, extinction risk, and the physics of flight and sound probably also interacted with biotic filters at local and/or regional scales to influence the community structure of sympatric bats in southern Africa.

However, differential rates of change and the evolutionary mechanisms driving those rates result in pervasive phylogenetic conflict. These drivers need to be uncovered because mismatches between evolutionary processes and phylogenetic models can lead to high confidence in incorrect hypotheses. Incongruence between phylogenies derived from morphological versus molecular analyses, and between trees based on different subsets of molecular sequences has become pervasive as datasets have expanded rapidly in both characters and species. For more than a decade, evolutionary relationships among members of the New World bat family Phyllostomidae inferred from morphological and molecular data have been in conflict. Here, we develop and apply methods to minimize systematic biases, uncover the biological mechanisms underlying phylogenetic conflict, and outline data requirements for future phylogenomic and morphological data collection. We introduce new morphological data for phyllostomids and outgroups and expand previous molecular analyses to eliminate methodological sources of phylogenetic conflict such as taxonomic sampling, sparse character sampling, or use of different algorithms to estimate the phylogeny. We also evaluate the impact of biological sources of conflict: saturation in morphological changes and molecular substitutions, and other processes that result in incongruent trees, including convergent morphological and molecular evolution. Methodological sources of incongruence play some role in generating phylogenetic conflict, and are relatively easy to eliminate by matching taxa, collecting more characters, and applying the same algorithms to optimize phylogeny. The evolutionary patterns uncovered are consistent with multiple biological sources of conflict, including saturation in morphological and molecular changes, adaptive morphological convergence among nectar-feeding lineages, and incongruent gene trees. Applying methods to account for nucleotide sequence saturation reduces, but does not completely eliminate, phylogenetic conflict. We ruled out paralogy, lateral gene transfer, and poor taxon sampling and outgroup choices among the processes leading to incongruent gene trees in phyllostomid bats. Uncovering and countering the possible effects of introgression and lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphism on gene trees will require great leaps in genomic and allelic sequencing in this species-rich mammalian family. We also found evidence for adaptive molecular evolution leading to convergence in mitochondrial proteins among nectar-feeding lineages. In conclusion, the biological processes that generate phylogenetic conflict are ubiquitous, and overcoming incongruence requires better models and more data than have been collected even in well-studied organisms such as phyllostomid bats.","2012","2025-02-10 21:31:15","2025-02-10 21:31:15","2025-02-10 21:31:15","991-1024","","4","87","","","Understanding phylogenetic incongruence","","","","","","","en","© 2012 The Authors.

Here, we draw attention to inherent problems of comparative brain size studies, highlighting limitations but also suggesting alternative approaches. We argue that the complexity and diversity of neurological tasks that the brain and its functional regions (subdivisions) must solve cannot be explained by a single or few variables representing selective pressures. Using an example we show that by adding a single relevant variable, morphological adaptation to foraging strategy, to a previous analysis a correlation between brain and testes mass disappears completely and changes entirely the interpretation of the study. Future studies should not only look for novel determinants of brain size but also include known correlates in order to add to our current knowledge.

In Bechstein’s bats, Myotis bechsteinii, the species with the highest sample size, we furthermore investigated if fluctuating asymmetry has become more frequent over the study period, a time when juvenile bats have grown larger forearms in response to warmer summers. We also investigated whether fluctuating asymmetry affects individual lifespan and lifetime reproductive success in female Myotis bechsteinii. The degree of fluctuating asymmetry clearly exceeding the measurement error estimated on recaptured individuals was similar in all three species (1.8%). In female Myotis bechsteinii, the frequency of fluctuating asymmetry did not increase over the course of the study and even strong asymmetry had no effect on individual reproductive success and life expectancy. Our data suggest that fluctuating asymmetry is a poor predictor of fitness in the female Myotis bechsteinii studied, and is so far unaffected by the warming environment which is leading to larger individuals in our study population.","2024-11-20","2025-02-10 21:31:31","2025-02-10 21:31:31","2025-02-10 21:31:31","28736","","1","14","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RQZHIGTJ\Süess y Kerth - 2024 - Long-term patterns of forearm asymmetry in females of three syntopic bat species and its effects on.pdf","","","Conservation biology; Evolutionary ecology; Ecology; Evolution; Zoology; Animal behaviour; Sexual selection; Behavioural ecology; Forest ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cranial ecomorphological adaptations linked to diet have been widely studied in bats, using a variety of anatomical, computational and mathematical approaches. However, foraging-related ecomorphological adaptations and the concordance between cranial and postcranial morphological adaptations remain unexamined in bats and limited to the interpretation of traditional aerodynamic properties of the wing (e.g. wing loading [WL] and aspect ratio [AR]). For this reason, the postcranial ecomorphological diversity in bats and its drivers remain understudied. Using 3D virtual modelling and geometric morphometrics (GMM), we explored the phylogenetic, ecological and biological drivers of humeral morphology in bats, evaluating the presence and magnitude of modularity and integration. To explore decoupled patterns of variation across the bone, we analysed whole-bone shape, diaphyseal and epiphyseal shape. We also tested whether traditional aerodynamic wing traits correlate with humeral shape. By studying 37 species from 20 families (covering all FGs and 85% of dietary guilds), we found similar patterns of variation in whole-bone and diaphyseal shape and unique variation patterns in epiphyseal shape. Phylogeny, diet and FG significantly correlated with shape variation at all levels, whereas size only had a significant effect on epiphyseal morphology. We found a significant phylogenetic signal in all levels of humeral shape. Epiphyseal shape significantly correlated with wing AR. Statistical support for a diaphyseal-epiphyseal modular partition of the humerus suggests a functional partition of shape variability. Our study is the first to show within-structure modular morphological variation in the appendicular skeleton of any living tetrapod. Our results suggest that diaphyseal shape correlates more with phylogeny, whereas epiphyseal shape correlates with diet and FG.","2021","2025-02-10 21:31:49","2025-02-10 21:31:49","2025-02-10 21:31:49","1312-1329","","6","238","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 Anatomical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/joa.13380","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\HEH5FPQD\López-Aguirre et al. - 2021 - Phylogeny and foraging behaviour shape modular morphological variation in bat humeri.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Q2IWZL2K\joa.html","","","Chiroptera; functional morphology; foraging ecology; humerus; geometric morphometrics; modularity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially, small endothermic animals require large amounts of energy to maintain high and stable body temperatures (Tb) via endogenous heat production. To deal with energetic challenges, many small endotherms are heterothermic, abandon regulation of high Tb and enter a state of torpor resulting in large energy savings. Torpor is used by many bat species because they are small, have high rates of heat loss and rely on fluctuating food resources (e.g. insects, fruit, nectar). Many bats use torpor all year, but the expression of temporal heterothermy can be strongly seasonal especially for temperate and subtropical species, which may hibernate for long periods. Recent advances in our understanding of torpor expression in bats have been made using temperature telemetry for remote data collection of Tb in free-ranging wild individuals from all climate zones. This new knowledge on free-ranging bats has revealed the importance of torpor expression not only for energy conservation but also for other benefits, such as reduction of extrinsic mortality (e.g. predation). On the contrary, dense clustering during hibernation, important for minimizing energy and water loss, may also expose bats to infectious disease. An emerging, cold-tolerant fungal pathogen of bats causes a new disease called white-nose syndrome (WNS), which is devastating populations of multiple species in eastern North America. Given the importance of temporal heterothermy to their biology, and links between torpor expression and mortality from WNS, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the ecology and physiology of torpor in this largely understudied and cryptic mammalian group. Here, we review past and current literature to summarize the importance and evolution of heterothermy in bats.","2014","2025-02-10 21:32:31","2025-02-10 21:32:31","2025-02-10 21:32:31","86-100","","2","292","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Zoological Society of London","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jzo.12105","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\EIHD6L6G\Stawski et al. - 2014 - The importance of temporal heterothermy in bats.pdf","","","bat; hibernation; chiroptera; disease; reproduction; white-nose syndrome; heterothermy; torpor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cranio-muscular morphology determines how wide, forcefully, and quickly the jaw can be opened or closed, which limits the size and material properties of the foods that a mammal can eat. Most studies of feeding performance in mammals have focused on skull form and jaw muscles involved in generating bite force, but few explore how jaw abduction is related to feeding performance. In this study, we explored how the morphology of the digastric muscle, the primary jaw abducting muscle in mammals, and its jaw lever mechanics are related to diet in morphologically diverse noctilionoid bats. Results showed that insectivorous bats have strong digastric muscles associated with proportionally long jaws, which suggests these species can open their jaws quickly and powerfully during prey capture and chewing. Short snouted frugivorous bats exhibit traits that would enable them to open their jaws proportionally wider to accommodate the large fruits that they commonly feed on. Our results support the hypothesis that digastric muscle and jaw morphology are correlated with diet in bats, and that our results may also apply to other groups of mammals.

We then evaluate a series of phylogenetic generalized least-squares models containing up to nine variables hypothesized to influence extrinsic mortality. These analyses reveal that body mass and hibernation predict longevity. Among hibernators, longevity is predicted by the absolute value of the median latitude of the species range and cave use, while cave use and lack of sexual dimorphism predict longevity among non-hibernators. The importance of torpor in extending lifespan is further supported by the one lineage with extreme longevity that does not hibernate but exhibits flexible thermoregulation, the common vampire bat. We propose several potential mechanisms that may enable bats to live so long, and suggest that the ability to tolerate a wide range of body temperatures could be important for surviving viral or other pathogen infections.","2019-04-10","2025-02-10 21:32:45","2025-02-10 21:32:45","2025-02-10 21:32:45","20180860","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\E6QBAN2E\Wilkinson y Adams - 2019 - Recurrent evolution of extreme longevity in bats.pdf","","","sexual dimorphism; lifespan; hibernation duration; phylogenetic generalized least squares","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a machine learning algorithm, generalized boosted regression, we characterize potential filovirus-positive bat species with estimated 87% accuracy. Our model produces two specific outputs with immediate utility for guiding filovirus surveillance in the wild. First, we report a profile of intrinsic traits that discriminates hosts from non-hosts, providing a biological caricature of a filovirus-positive bat species. This profile emphasizes traits describing adult and neonate body sizes and rates of reproductive fitness, as well as species’ geographic range overlap with regions of high mammalian diversity. Second, we identify several bat species ranked most likely to be filovirus-positive on the basis of intrinsic trait similarity with known filovirus-positive bats.

Call features, such as frequency, bandwidth, duration and pulse interval are all related to ecological niche. Recent technological breakthroughs have aided our understanding of adaptive aspects of call design in free-living bats. Stereo videogrammetry, laser scanning of habitat features and acoustic flight path tracking permit reconstruction of the flight paths of echolocating bats relative to obstacles and prey in nature. These methods show that echolocation calls are among the most intense airborne vocalizations produced by animals. Acoustic tracking has clarified how and why bats vary call structure in relation to flight speed. Bats using broadband echolocation calls adjust call design in a range-dependent manner so that nearby obstacles are localized accurately. Recent phylogenetic analyses based on gene sequences show that particular types of echolocation signals have evolved independently in several lineages of bats. Call design is often influenced more by perceptual challenges imposed by the environment than by phylogeny, and provides excellent examples of convergent evolution. Now that whole genome sequences of bats are imminent, understanding the functional genomics of echolocation will become a major challenge.","2007-01-16","2025-02-10 21:32:58","2025-02-10 21:32:58","2025-02-10 21:32:58","905-912","","1612","274","","","Bat echolocation calls","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\HHCEMPGG\Jones y Holderied - 2007 - Bat echolocation calls adaptation and convergent evolution.pdf","","","bats; echolocation; convergent evolution; adaptation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vertebrates, bite force is a measure of whole organism performance that is associated with both cranial morphology and dietary ecology. Mechanistic studies of bite force production have identified morphological features associated with bite force, and linked bite force with diet, but this approach has rarely been used in mammals. 2. Mammals are a good system with which to investigate the function of the feeding apparatus because of the relative simplicity of their skulls and their high dietary diversity. Phyllostomid bats are one of the most trophically and morphologically diverse groups of mammals, but we know little about the relative importance of biomechanical variables in producing bite force or how these variables vary with diet. 3. We combined in vivo measurements of bite force with assessments of muscular and bony morphology to build and validate a model describing the mechanics of bite force production in 25 species of bats. We used this model to investigate how bats with different diets vary in biomechanical parameters that contribute to bite force. In addition to traditional dietary categories, we used a functional definition of diet that reflects the mechanical demands (hardness) of the food items in the natural diet. 4. Our model provided good predictions of in vivo bite forces and highlighted behavioural variation that is inherent in the in vivo data. The temporalis generates the highest moment about the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) axis, but the moment generated by the masseter is the most important variable in explaining variation among species. The dietary classification based on the hardness of the diet was more effective than traditional dietary categories in describing biomechanical differences among groups. The temporalis generated the highest proportion of the moment about the TMJ axis in species with very hard and hard diets, the masseter was most important for species with soft diets, and the medial pterygoid was most important for species with liquid diets. 5. Our results highlight the utility of combining a modelling approach with in vivo data when conducting ecomorphological studies, and the importance of ecological classifications that reflect functional importance of performance traits.","2010","2025-02-10 21:33:04","2025-02-10 21:33:04","2025-02-10 21:33:04","776-784","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2010 The Authors.

The evolution of echolocation has fascinated and intrigued scientists for decades and has stimulated many phylogenetic studies to resolve the evolutionary history of bats and laryngeal echolocation. In this chapter, the consensus and conflict regarding bat evolutionary relationships is explored based on key phylogenetic studies conducted over the past 15 years. The consequential conclusions regarding the evolution of bats’ unique sensory perception are detailed. Using these consensus phylogenies as an evolutionary framework, the search for the genomic signatures of echolocation is described, and the spectacular unprecedented sequence convergence observed between echolocating bats and whales is highlighted. What is currently known about the molecular basis of echolocation is detailed and the future steps required to link this trait with its genomic bases are explored. It is often argued that the evolution of one specialization will have consequences for other traits, and, in the case of echolocation, a “trade-off” between the senses must occur. In this chapter, the potential molecular sensory trade-offs between echolocation, vision, olfaction, and taste are explored. Finally, the next steps required to ultimately reach a universal consensus regarding bat phylogenetic relationships are discussed together with future directions for elucidating the genomic basis of echolocation in mammals and the extent of molecular “trade-offs” that occur in these unique species.","2016","2025-02-10 21:33:14","2025-02-10 21:33:14","2025-02-10 21:33:14","25-54","","","","","","Phylogeny, Genes, and Hearing","","","","","Springer","New York, NY","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3527-7_2","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\P8JA36WT\Teeling et al. - 2016 - Phylogeny, Genes, and Hearing Implications for the Evolution of Echolocation in Bats.pdf","","","Yangochiroptera; Yinpterochiroptera; Olfaction; Taste; Bat hearing; Bat vision; Cetacea; Convergence; Laurasiatheria; Mammalian phylogeny; Megachiroptera; Microchiroptera; Molecular evolution; Pseudogenes; Sensory perception; Whales","Fenton, M.

Understanding the topology of bat–flower networks is fundamental to understand ecosystem functions. However, this mutualism has rarely been studied on a community-wide level. We applied network theory to analyze the bat–flower interactions in the Americas. We addressed three questions: what is the state of knowledge of the diet of nectarivorous phyllostomid bats? Are bat–flower interaction networks random or structured? Are specialized nectarivorous bats more central than facultative bats? We compiled information on bat–flower interactions in the Americas and built four matrices (Americas, South, Central-North, and Antilles). We calculated complementary specialization, nestedness, and quantitative modularity; and we assessed the functional role of bat and plant genera using two centrality metrics. We found 61 phyllostomid bat species that visited 277 flowering plant species. The most important bats were Glossophaga soricina, Leptonycteris yerbabuenae and Anoura geoffroyi. The most important plant species were Ceiba pentandra, Cordia alliodora and Pseudobombax ellipticum. Most networks were specialized, modular, and non-nested; however, in the Antilles the networks were nested, unspecialized, and not modular. The specialist bat genera Glossophaga and Anoura were the genera most central as hubs, and the facultative genera Phyllostomus and Artibeus were connectors. The plant genera Ceiba, Pseudobombax, Ochroma and Pilosocereus were central as connector hubs. Nectarivorous specialist bats demonstrate more interactions, maintaining the entire system; meanwhile facultative bats were connectors, binding different parts of the network.

These joints collectively affect dynamic three-dimensional (3D) wing shape, thereby affecting the amount of aerodynamic force a wing can generate. Bats are a speciose group, and show substantial variation in the number of wing joints. Additionally, some bat species have joints with extensor but no flexor muscles. While several studies have examined the diversity in number of joints and presence of muscles, musculoskeletal variation in the digits has not been interpreted in phylogenetic, functional or ecological contexts. To provide this context, the number of joints and the presence/absence of muscles are quantified for 44 bat species, and are mapped phylogenetically. It is shown that, relative to the ancestral state, joints and muscles were lost multiple times from different digits and in many lineages. It is also shown that joints lacking flexors undergo cyclical flexion and extension, in a manner similar to that observed in joints with both flexors and extensors. Comparison of species with contrasting feeding ecologies demonstrates that species that feed primarily on non-mobile food (e.g. fruit) have fewer fully active joints than species that catch mobile prey (e.g. insects). It is hypothesized that there is a functional trade-off between energetic savings and maneuverability. Having fewer joints and muscles reduces the mass of the wing, thereby reducing the energetic requirements of flapping flight, and having more joints increases the assortment of possible 3D wing shapes, thereby enhancing the range and fine control of aerodynamic force production and thus maneuverability.","2016","2025-02-10 21:33:34","2025-02-10 21:33:34","2025-02-10 21:33:34","114-127","","1","229","","","Simplifying a wing","","","","","","","en","© 2016 Anatomical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/joa.12457","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\RVCGDGBM\Bahlman et al. - 2016 - Simplifying a wing diversity and functional consequences of digital joint reduction in bat wings.pdf","","","Chiroptera; bat; flight; anatomy; wing; joint; muscle loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We predicted that (i) our three different biodiversity dimensions (species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity) will have a positive relationship with habitat heterogeneity; (ii) variation in phylogenetic diversity will be positively influenced by elevation; (iii) biodiversity dimensions will be influenced by climatic stability, with less diversity in regions with higher climatic instability. Location Neotropical Savannah (Cerrado). Methods We calculated nine metrics: species richness, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, mean paired functional distance (MFD) and phylogenetic distances (MPD), richness-corrected functional diversity (SES-FD), richness-corrected phylogenetic diversity (SES-PD) and richness-corrected mean functional and phylogenetic distances (SES.MFD and SES.MPD) using distribution records for 111 bat species. Habitat heterogeneity, climatic variables, elevation, floristic and climatic stability were used as independent variables. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to spatialise biodiversity dimensions based on the best predictors. Results Cerrado habitat heterogeneity is important for phylogenetic diversity and mean functional and paired phylogenetic distances. Precipitation, temperature, elevation, habitat heterogeneity, and climatic stability were the most important predictors of Cerrado bat biodiversity. Species richness is inversely related to climatic instability, which is the best predictor of this metric. There is a decline in species richness in regions where the floristic composition has been more altered during the last 30,000 years, mainly in southern Cerrado. Main Conclusions Present-day and historical factors simultaneously explain the biodiversity dimensions of bat communities in the Cerrado. Habitat heterogeneity is a major driver of phylogenetic diversity of Cerrado bats, and species of closely related lineages share habitats with homogeneous vegetation. Cerrado climatic changes and geologic history influenced the observed diversity metrics (PD and FD) and the ones corrected for species richness (SES-PD and SES-FD) in opposite ways. Species richness corrected metrics (SES-PD and SES-FD) indicate that species filtered by adaptive traits mainly occupied regions of climatic instability.","2024","2025-02-10 21:33:45","2025-02-10 21:33:45","2025-02-10 21:33:45","940-955","","5","51","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jbi.14798","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\B2WRIC4T\Silva et al. - 2024 - Cerrado bat community assembly is determined by both present-day and historical factors.pdf","","","biogeography; Chiroptera; climate stability; INLA-SPDE; Neotropical region; Savannah","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We applied comparative methods to identify shifts in adaptive peaks and to detect divergence and convergence in skull morphology of frugivorous bats (Phyllostomidae: Stenodermatinae and Carollinae), an ecologically diverse group with strong association between skull morphology, feeding performance and diet that suggests adaptive diversification through morphological innovation. We found divergence and convergence for skull morphology. Fifteen peak shifts were found for jaws, which result in four convergent and four divergent regimes. For skull, nine peak shifts were detected that result in three convergent and three divergent regimes. Furthermore, convergence was significant and strong for skull morphology since distantly related organisms converged to the same adaptive optima. Results suggest that convergence indicates the effect of restriction on phenotypes to keep the advantages provided by the skull phenotype that played a central role in the evolution of strict frugivory in phyllostomids.

Potential effects for many locations and species therefore remain unclear. To redress this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of recorded collisions between birds and bats and wind turbines within developed countries. We related collision rate to species-level traits and turbine characteristics to quantify the potential vulnerability of 9538 bird and 888 bat species globally. Avian collision rate was affected by migratory strategy, dispersal distance and habitat associations, and bat collision rates were influenced by dispersal distance. For birds and bats, larger turbine capacity (megawatts) increased collision rates; however, deploying a smaller number of large turbines with greater energy output reduced total collision risk per unit energy output, although bat mortality increased again with the largest turbines. Areas with high concentrations of vulnerable species were also identified, including migration corridors. Our results can therefore guide wind farm design and location to reduce the risk of large-scale animal mortality.

In a pooled principal component analysis, species belonging to Lonchophyllinae and Glossophaginae occupy similar regions in morphospace, though the latter species have a greater variance. Principal components and common principal components analyses for separate taxonomic lineages (subfamilies, tribes and subtribes) revealed distinct static allometric trajectories among these groups, with variables associated with elongation of the rostrum having distinct allometric coefficients. Our results indicate that distinct cranial morphotypes associated with the degree of elongation of the rostrum in phyllostomid nectarivores are allometrically characteristic of each lineage.

In this study, we reviewed the status of bat diversity in the arid parts of southern Africa, with the aim of setting up a baseline for future work. In particular, we described species richness patterns across four arid zones within the region (Namib Desert, Kalahari, Nama Karoo and Succulent Karoo), exploring abiotic gradients and local landscape structure. Additionally, we examined bat functional groups in this region and compared them with those of three other arid regions of the world to identify potential similarities and diﬀerences. The southern African arid region hosted 17 bat species, representing eight families, of which three are endemic to the region (Rhinolophus denti, Laephotis namibensis and Cistugo seabrae) and one is vagrant (the fruit bat Eidolon helvum). Species richness varied spatially within this arid region, being highest in the drier but topographically heterogeneous Namib Desert, probably as a result of roost availability. With regards to functional groups, the southern African arid region had few bat species adapted to foraging in open spaces, particularly when compared with the neighbouring savannahs. Drawing from this study, we suggest that: a) despite species richness decreasing with increasing aridity at the sub-continental scale, at a more local scale landscape features (e.g. habitat structure) might be more relevant than aridity in determining bat species richness; and b) an unknown factor, possibly patterns of temperature limiting the availability of insects ﬂying high above the ground, restricted the diversity of the open air foragers throughout the region. We highlight additional areas of research worth investigation.","2018","2025-02-10 21:40:49","2025-02-10 21:40:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\K8YFDV2J\Monadjem et al. - 2018 - Species richness patterns and functional traits of the bat fauna of arid southern Africa.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This diversity includes three echolocation modalities and numerous dietary specializations, which have been linked to ecological, behavioral, and sensory adaptations. Previous analyses have suggested that the positioning of the rostrum relative to the basicranium (upturned or downturned snout) is linked to the evolution of echolocation modes. I tested this hypothesis directly by quantifying rostral flexion via 3D geometric morphometrics and using phylogenetic comparative methods to detect macroevolutionary patterns across 235 species of bats. I found that >30% of variation in skull shape is linked to rostral flexion. Disparity though time analysis indicates that the rostral angle of modern lineages was established early in the evolution of most clades, and that echolocator modes have different adaptive optima. Finally, I analyzed biomechanical consequences associated with extreme upturned rostra. I found that unilateral bites have an increase of stress associated with a decrease in rostral flexion (upturned snout) then an increase in flexion (downturned rostrum). This provides evidence for variation in dietary opportunity between different echolocating groups. Overall, I find that rostral flexion is a key element of cranial diversity of bats that played a strong role early in the adaptation of this trait and has broad ranging consequences for the biomechanical properties of the skull. Evolution to different echolocation modes likely significantly constrained subsequent diversification of the skull, helping to explain part of the overall diversity of skull form in this remarkable clade.","2022","2025-02-10 21:47:24","2025-02-10 21:47:24","2025-02-10 21:47:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","jewlscholar.mtsu.edu","","Publisher: Middle Tennessee State University","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\SVYRMH4X\Gilley - 2022 - Evolution of Cranial Morphology and the Functional Consequences of Echolocation in Bats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
