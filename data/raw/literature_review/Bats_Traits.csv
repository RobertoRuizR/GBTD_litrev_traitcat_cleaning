In the context of climate change, there is evidence that some bat species are increasing their body size via phenotypic responses to higher temperatures at maternity roosts. To test the generality of this response, we conducted a >20-year study examining body size changes in 15 bat species in Italy, analysing data from 4393 individual bats captured since 1995. In addition to examining the temporal effect, we considered the potential influence of sexual dimorphism and, where relevant, included latitude and altitude as potential drivers of body size change. Contrary to initial predictions of a widespread increase in size, our findings challenge this assumption, revealing a nuanced interplay of factors contributing to the complexity of bat body size dynamics. Specifically, only three species (Myotis daubentonii, Nyctalus leisleri, and Pipistrellus pygmaeus) out of the 15 exhibited a discernible increase in body size over the studied period, prompting a reassessment of bats as reliable indicators of climate change based on alterations in body size. Our investigation into influencing factors highlighted the significance of temperature-related variables, with latitude and altitude emerging as crucial drivers. In some cases, this mirrored patterns consistent with Bergmann's rule, revealing larger bats recorded at progressively higher latitudes (Plecotus auritus, Myotis mystacinus, and Miniopterus schreibersii) or altitudes (Pipistrellus kuhlii). We also observed a clear sexual dimorphism effect in most species, with females consistently larger than males. The observed increase in size over time in three species suggests the occurrence of phenotypic plasticity, raising questions about potential long-term selective pressures on larger individuals. The unresolved question of whether temperature-related changes in body size reflect microevolutionary processes or phenotypic plastic responses adds further complexity to our understanding of body size patterns in bats over time and space.",2024,17/10/2024 21:25,12/11/2024 19:59,17/10/2024 21:25,e10872,,2,14,,,"Climate is changing, are European bats too?",,,,,,,en,© 2024 The Authors.

We compare hypotheses on the causes of interspecific differences in fragmentation sensitivity using distribution and abundance data collected on 23 species of Neotropical bats. 2 Bats were captured over a 2-year period on 11 land-bridge islands in Gatún Lake, Panama, and on the adjacent mainland. We derived a series of explanatory variables from our capture data and from the literature: (1) natural abundance in continuous forest, (2) body mass, (3) trophic level, (4) dietary specialization, (5) vertical stratification, (6) edge-sensitivity, (7) mobility, (8) wing morphology (aspect ratio and relative wing loading) and (9) ecologically scaled landscape indices (ESLIs). After phylogenetic correction, these variables were used separately and in combination to assess their association with two indices of fragmentation sensitivity, species prevalence (proportion of islands occupied) as well as an index of change in abundance. 3 Model selection based on Akaike's information criterion identified edge-sensitivity as the best correlate of vulnerability to fragmentation. Natural abundance and mobility or traits linked to mobility (relative wing loading and ESLI) received limited support as predictors. Vulnerability of gleaning animalivorous bats is probably caused by a combination of these traits. 4 Synthesis and applications. Our findings emphasize the importance of a local-scale approach in developing predictive models of species fragmentation sensitivity and indicate that risk assessments of Neotropical bats could be based on species tolerance to habitat edges and mobility-related traits. We suggest that, in order to be effective, management efforts should aim to minimize the amount of edge-habitat and reduce the degree of fragment-matrix contrast. Moreover, if high bat diversity is to be preserved in fragmented Neotropical landscapes, conservation measures regarding reserve design should assure spatial proximity to source populations in larger tracts of continuous forest and a low degree of remnant isolation.",2008,29/01/2024 23:39,12/11/2024 19:59,29/01/2024 23:39,381-391,,1,45,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2007 The Authors,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01389.x,,C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\33XYKZYI\Meyer et al. - 2008 - Ecological correlates of vulnerability to fragment.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\LXZNXKC2\Meyer et al. - 2008 - Ecological correlates of vulnerability to fragmentation in Neotropical bats.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\3LVCC5W2\j.1365-2664.2007.01389.html,,,sensitivity; Chiroptera; vulnerability; ecological traits; habitat fragmentation; land-bridge islands; Panama,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development and growth of global species’ trait databases are critical for improving trait-based analyses; however, it is vital to understand the gaps and biases in the available data. We reviewed bat wing morphology data, specifically mass, wingspan, wing area, wing loading, and aspect ratio, to identify issues with data reporting and ambiguity. Additionally, we aimed to assess taxonomic and geographic biases in trait data coverage. We found that most studies used similar field methodology, but that data reporting and quality were inconsistent/poor. Additionally, we noted several issues regarding semantic ambiguity in trait definitions, specifically around what constitutes wing area. Globally, we found that bat wing morphology trait coverage was low. Only six bat families had ≥40% trait coverage, and, of those, none consisted of more than 11 species in total. We found similar biases in trait coverage across International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categories, with threatened species having lower coverage. Geographically, North America, Europe, and the Indomalayan regions exhibited higher overall trait coverage, while both the Afrotropical and Neotropical ecoregions showed poor trait coverage. The underlying biases and gaps in bat wing morphology data have implications for researchers conducting global trait-based assessments. Implementing imputation techniques may address missing data, but only for smaller regional subsets with substantial trait coverage. Due to generally low overall trait coverage, increasing species’ representation in the database should be prioritised. We suggest adopting an Ecological Trait Standard Vocabulary to reduce semantic ambiguity in bat wing morphology traits, to improve data compilation and clarity.

Recently, trait-based approaches have been used in several taxa to better understand mechanisms underlying species assemblages, biotic interactions, environmental relationships and ecosystem functions. However, despite the relevance of bats on ecosystem dynamics, so far, there is no conceptual framework that relies on the measurement of bat traits to address functional studies. Here, we present a set of 50 bat biological traits, which are suitable to assess environmental stressors and can potentially affect ecological processes. Several examples were provided to show the applicability of this framework in the study of Neotropical bat ecology. We suggest some considerations regarding trait-based approach including the importance of intraspecific variation, correlations between traits, response-effect framework, global dataset, and future directions to assess the reliability of functional relations across species and Neotropical regions by using traits. This could be helpful in tackling ecological questions associated with community assembly and habitat filtering, species diversity patterns along environmental gradients, and ecological processes.

Speed is positively correlated with aspect ratio and tip index, but regresses significantly only on the former. Long tips coupled with low aspect ratio may characterize hoverers.

The morphology of the larynx is known to reflect vocal adaptation and thus can potentially help in resolving this controversy. However, the morphological variations of the larynx are poorly known in bats, and a complete anatomical study remains to be conducted. Here, we compare the 3D laryngeal morphology of 23 extant bat species of 11 different families reconstructed by using iodine contrast-enhanced X-ray microtomography techniques. We find that, contrary to previously thought, laryngeal muscle hypertrophy is not a characteristic of all bats and presents differential development. The larynges of Pteropodidae are morphologically similar to those of non-bat mammals. Two morphotypes are described among laryngeal echolocating bats, illustrating morphological differences between Rhinolophoidea and Yangochiroptera, with the main variations being the cricothyroid muscle volume and the shape of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. For the first time we detail functional specialization for constant frequency echolocation among Rhinolophoidea.

Bats are of particular interest for studies of mating systems as they are thought to exhibit a greater diversity in mating systems than any other mammalian order, and thus make great models for improving our fundamental understanding of causes and consequences of social organisation. Here, we review the current knowledge of bat mating systems. Our analyses show that research on bat mating systems has not kept pace with research on bats in general and that traditional typologies do not accommodate the mating system of several species. Therefore, we propose an alternative, functional framework to categorise mating systems of bats and by extension of other taxa. We argue that mating systems can be classified according to a male reproductive skew continuum, with an increasing skew from monogamy to true lekking. We include an additional category of lek-like mating system along the continuum to account for previous trans-categorical cases that have the appearance of resource defence but are functionally akin to a lek. The new framework has a total of seven categories: promiscuity, monogamy, female defence polygyny, resource defence polygyny, a lek-like mating system, exploded classical lek, and clustered classical lek. Applying this framework to bats reveals that lek mating systems are more prevalent in bats than previously recognised. It is our aim that this review and the proposed framework provide a greater understanding of bat mating systems particularly and provoke research into the factors that shape mating systems across animal taxa more generally.",2024,11/11/2024 21:25,11/11/2024 21:25,11/11/2024 21:25,e70149,,8,14,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2024 The Author(s).

Empirical evidence regarding this question remains limited for many tropical regions despite their importance for conservation. Here, we used body mass, wing morphology, trophic level, and diet to identify which traits make phyllostomid bat species more vulnerable to human impacts in the Colombian Orinoco Llanos. Bats were sampled using mist nets in riparian forests, unflooded forests, flooded savannahs, and conventional rice crops on traditional farmlands with high-intensity agriculture and in private reserves with greater ecosystem protection. We tested the associations between species traits and landscape-structure variables (habitat cover and type, number of habitat patches, shortest distance to water) using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, accounting for both spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelation. Trophic level and diet were the most important traits linked to disturbance sensitivity. Our results indicated that rice crop cover, savannah patches, and altered unflooded forest act as a filter, benefiting disturbance-adapted frugivorous genera in farmlands (e.g., Artibeus spp., Carollia spp., Platyrrhinus spp., Uroderma spp.). Conversely, animalivorous species were strongly associated with savannah cover and riparian forests within reserves (e.g., Lampronycteris brachyotis, Lophostoma brasiliense, Micronycteris minuta, Trachops cirrhosus).

Their feeding niche diversification has shaped skull and wing morphologies through natural selection, reflecting food processing and flight strategies. Yet, evolution of bat hindlimbs, especially in phyllostomids, remains little understood. Previous studies highlighted the femur's morphology as a key to understanding the evolution of quadrupedalism in yangochiropteran bats, including the adept walking observed in vampire bats (Desmodontinae). Here, we aimed to describe the femoral morphological variation in Phyllostomidae, correlating this with body size and assessing the effects of phylogenetic history, dietary habits, and hindlimb usage. Analyzing 15 femoral traits from 45 species across 9 subfamilies through phylogenetically informed methods, we discovered a significant phylogenetic structure in femoral morphology. Allometric analysis indicated that body mass accounts for about 85% of the variance in phyllostomid femoral size and about 11% in femoral shape. Relatively smaller femurs showed to be typical in Stenodermatinae, Lonchophyllinae, and Glossophaginae, in contrast to the larger femurs of Phyllostominae, Desmodontinae, Micronycterinae, and Lonchorrhininae. Furthermore, extensive femur shape variation was detected, with the most distinct morphologies in vampire bats, followed by frugivorous species. Adaptive evolutionary models related to diet more effectively explained variations in femoral relative size and shape than stochastic models. Contrary to the conventional belief of limited functional demand on bat femurs, our findings suggest that femoral morphology is significantly influenced by functional demands associated with diet and food capture, in addition to being partially structured by body size and shared evolutionary history.",2024,14/11/2024 19:48,08/01/2025 22:05,14/11/2024 19:48,,,n/a,n/a,,,Beyond head and wings,,,,,,,en,© 2024 American Association for Anatomy.,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ar.25551,,"C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Z8P6H3PE\Louzada y Tavares - Beyond head and wings Unveiling influence of diet, body size, and phylogeny on the evolution of the.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\8U6653CG\ar.html",,,functional morphology; gleaning bats; hindlimbs; leaf-nosed bats; neotropics; quadrupedal bats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we sought to understand the phenotypic evolution of key traits in Rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats) using phylogenetic comparative methods. We aimed to test the phylogenetic signals of traits, and evaluated the best-fit evolutionary models given the data for each trait considering different traits may evolve under different models (i.e., Brownian Motion [BM], Ornstein-Uhlenbeck [OU], and Early Burst [EB]) and reconstruct ancestral character states. We examined how phenotypic characters are associated with echolocation calls and minimum detectable prey size. We measured 34 traits of 10 Asian rhinolophids species (187 individuals). We found that the majority of traits showed a high phylogenetic signal based on Blomberg′s K and Pagel′s λ, but each trait may evolve under different evolutionary models. Sella traits were shown to evolve under stabilizing selection based on OU models, indicating sella traits have the tendency to move forward along the branches toward some medial value in equilibrium. Our findings highlight the importance of sella characters in association with echolocation call emissions in Rhinolophidae, as calls are important for spatial cognition and also influence dietary preferences. Minimum detectable prey size in Rhinolophidae was associated with call frequency, bandwidth, call duration, wingspan, and wing surface area.

This has generated strong selective pressure on the morphology and function of their digestive system. Given that in bats intestinal length and nominal surface-area are proportional to body mass, this trait importantly relates to explaining some of their digestive characteristics. We described the relationship between digestive traits and body mass of four species of bats of the family Vespertilionidae living in a montane ecosystem in central Mexico. We calculated food transit time, apparent dry matter digestibility, and defecation rate in feeding trials under captive conditions. We also: (1) built a model of the relationship between digestive traits and body mass to determine if this association was consistent within the members of the family Vespertilionidae, and (2) mapped these traits along the phylogeny to explore how digestive characteristics may have evolved. In our feeding trials, body mass was positively related to transit time and negatively related to apparent dry matter digestibility. The model predicted accurately the transit time in bats with body mass < 20 g. The phylogenetic approach suggested that over the evolutionary history of the family, transit time decreased as digestibility increased. Because of the results obtained here, it is likely that for most bats of the family Vespertilionidae, adaptations in digestive traits to process food have followed evolutionary changes in their body mass.

Cranial ecomorphological adaptations linked to diet have been widely studied in bats, using a variety of anatomical, computational and mathematical approaches. However, foraging-related ecomorphological adaptations and the concordance between cranial and postcranial morphological adaptations remain unexamined in bats and limited to the interpretation of traditional aerodynamic properties of the wing (e.g. wing loading [WL] and aspect ratio [AR]). For this reason, the postcranial ecomorphological diversity in bats and its drivers remain understudied. Using 3D virtual modelling and geometric morphometrics (GMM), we explored the phylogenetic, ecological and biological drivers of humeral morphology in bats, evaluating the presence and magnitude of modularity and integration. To explore decoupled patterns of variation across the bone, we analysed whole-bone shape, diaphyseal and epiphyseal shape. We also tested whether traditional aerodynamic wing traits correlate with humeral shape. By studying 37 species from 20 families (covering all FGs and 85% of dietary guilds), we found similar patterns of variation in whole-bone and diaphyseal shape and unique variation patterns in epiphyseal shape. Phylogeny, diet and FG significantly correlated with shape variation at all levels, whereas size only had a significant effect on epiphyseal morphology. We found a significant phylogenetic signal in all levels of humeral shape. Epiphyseal shape significantly correlated with wing AR. Statistical support for a diaphyseal-epiphyseal modular partition of the humerus suggests a functional partition of shape variability. Our study is the first to show within-structure modular morphological variation in the appendicular skeleton of any living tetrapod.

Pteropodids are of significant concern in conservation due to rapidly declining populations resulting from habitat loss, climate change, and their impacts on agriculture and disease. We collected dental metrics from the mandibular postcanine teeth of 101 pteropodid specimens spanning six species within the family to test three hypotheses: H1) dental metrics are significantly different across pteropodid species; H2) variation in pteropodid dental metrics is associated with variation in body size; and H3) variation in pteropodid dental proportions is associated with phylogenetic relatedness. We find that dental linear metrics vary significantly across pteropodids and are significantly associated with body size.

Their legs are rotated through 180°, generally reduced in size, and in some extant taxa particular bones (e.g. fibula) can even be absent. The femur is the main leg bone, but to date few bat studies have considered its morphology in detail, none in a wide-scale comparative study. Yangochiroptera is the largest bat taxon, spans nearly three orders of magnitude in body mass, and is highly diverse both in ecology and behavior, representing a good model for comparative analyses. Here, we describe the anatomy of the femur in a large sample of yangochiropteran bats (125 species, 70 genera, and 12 families), and explore major trends of morphological variation and scaling patterns in this bone. We used 13 categorical characters in the anatomical description and five linear dimensions in the quantitative analyses. Based on the categorical data, each family studied here was diagnosed, and those from the Neotropical region were included in an identification key. From the phylogenetic principal component analysis (pPCA) we showed that, in addition to size, major axes of variation in bat femur are related to robusticity and head morphology, features that are clearly distinct among some families. We also generated a phylomorphospace based on pPCA scores, highlighting convergences in femur shape. Molossidae, Mystacinidae, and Desmodontinae were grouped based on their greater robusticity, a pattern that was also recovered from categorical data. In these families, we found anatomical features (e.g. presence of tubercles and posterior ridges on the greater trochanter, long or medially/distally displaced lateral ridges on the shaft) that are well-known from their functional link with quadrupedal locomotion. Using phylogenetic regressions, we found out that compared with body mass, femur length scaled with negative allometry, as expected, but that femur width scaled isometrically, counter to expectations. As a result, robusticity index (the ratio of width to length), scaled with positive allometry – larger bats tended to have more robust hindlimbs. At species level, our most remarkable finding was related to Myotis simus, which presented the most robust femur (for its size) among yangochiropterans. Our results reinforce the informative potential of the chiropteran femur from both taxonomic and functional perspectives. Furthermore, the allometric trends seen in this bone may help understand the strategies adopted by flying vertebrates to deal with the high energetic cost of flight and, at the same time, evolve diversified foraging behaviors.",2019,14/11/2024 20:08,14/11/2024 20:08,14/11/2024 20:08,124-150,,1,235,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2019 Anatomical Society,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/joa.12996,,C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\8SHVYGFR\Louzada et al. - 2019 - Comparative morphology and scaling of the femur in yangochiropteran bats.pdf,,,allometry; comparative methods; hindlimbs; bone robusticity; identification key; quadrupedalism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies addressing the identification of patterns and variations across several guilds are fundamental in ecomorphological research. Wings are the core of ecological morphology in bats; nevertheless, individual bones and structures that support the wing, including metacarpals, phalanges and the length of digits, have rarely been the subject of comprehensive research when studying wing morphology. Here, I analyzed morphological variations of wing structures across 11 bat guilds and how individual bone structures are correlated to diet, foraging mode and habitat use. I obtained wing measurements from 1512 voucher specimens of 97 species. All the specimens analyzed came from the Mammalian Collection at the Museo Javeriano de Historia Natural of Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (MPUJ-MAMM) (Bogotá, Colombia). Positive correlations between size and the length of the third and fifth digit were detected. Bat guilds that capture their preys using aerial strategy in uncluttered habitats had longer third digits but short fifth digits compared to guilds that rely on gleaning strategy and forage in highly cluttered space. Although terminal phalanges were shown to be important structures for guild classification, metacarpals were strongly related to aerial foragers from uncluttered habitats because of their potential role in flight performance and ecological adaptations. Results show that habitat use, as well as foraging mode, are reflected in wing structures. Different wing traits to those evaluated in this study should be considered to better understand the ecological interactions, foraging strategy, wing adaptations, and flight performance in Neotropical bats.",01/01/2020,09/01/2024 23:26,20/11/2024 20:20,,,,59,無,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (CSL JSON),,,,C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\7Q7EYM2C\Dennis Castillo-Figueroa - 2020 - Ecological Morphology of Neotropical Bat Wing Stru.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mammalian home range size has been linked to body size and diet, but these studies were based predominantly on terrestrial species and most specifically excluded bats. As the only group of flying mammals, bats experience distinctly different constraints on movement, and hence home range. However, despite their diversity, relatively little is known about the home ranges of bats, and this is the first global review assessing correlates of their home range size. Our hypothesis is that home range will be impacted by different ecological conditions experienced by the bats and by the biological traits of the bats themselves. We performed a meta-analysis based on published data for 81 bat species to identify variables that contribute most to home range size. Sex, wing loading, functional group, colony size, dietary class, distance from the equator (latitudinal region), habitat type, and the interaction between habitat type and latitudinal region were all important explanatory variables. Wing loading was positively correlated with home range size—while females, open-air foragers, large colony sizes, and bats in temperate regions consistently had large home ranges. Understanding the correlates of home range has important implications, for example, for bat conservation and for assessing the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens from bats to humans and livestock.",01/10/2024,19/09/2024 23:48,25/11/2024 20:45,14/11/2024 22:37,1044-1056,,5,105,,Journal of Mammalogy,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\SS3XPVH8\7664666.html,,To Read,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bats' role in those ecosystems is critical because of multiple bat-mediated processes. Such processes are strongly related to bats' functional traits. However, it is poorly known which bat's functional traits could relate to variations in environmental conditions in tropical dry forests. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that bat functional traits would be significantly associated with landscape variables, climatic variables, and land-use intensity. For testing these hypotheses, we used data from phyllostomid and mormoopid bats captured in mist nets and data from non-phyllostomid insectivorous bat species registered by passive acoustic monitoring. We considered six functional traits for phyllostomid and mormoopid bats, and for non-phyllostomid insectivorous bats, we added two echolocation parameters. We measured five environmental variables, two of local climate (daily maximum temperature and wind speed) and three of landscape features (total area of water and closeness, probability of finding caves, and conservation status). The relationships between bat functional traits and environmental variables were evaluated using the RLQ and the fourth-corner analysis. We captured 360 individuals belonging to 14 species with mist nets (Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae), and we identified 18 species and six sonotypes with acoustic sampling (Emballonuridae, Mormoopidae, Molossidae, Natalidae, Noctilionidae, and Vespertilionidae). We found that bats' functional traits related to environmental conditions were pulse structure, diet, vertical foraging stratification, and trophic level, although these relationships varied among bats' ecological roles. The hematophagous were related to water bodies' closeness, and animalivorous bats, mostly mormoopids, showed a relationship with the probability of finding caves. Insectivorous bats that mostly forage on the canopy and emit qCF calls were significantly related to more conserved sites, and bats that emit qCF pulses were significantly associated with less area covered by water. Our findings provide insights into how bat functional traits vary in their relationships with environmental conditions in harsh environments such as dry forests.</p>",27/07/2023,25/11/2024 21:06,25/11/2024 21:06,25/11/2024 21:06,,,,6,,Front.

Bats suffer from several threats caused by anthropization, including exposure to toxic metals and metalloids. We analyzed 75 papers in a systematic literature review to investigate how species, diet, and tissue type impact bioaccumulation. Most studies documented element accumulation in fur, liver, and kidney; at least 36 metals and metalloids have been measured in bat tissues, among the most studied were mercury and zinc. Comparisons with known toxicological thresholds for other mammals showed concerning values for mercury and zinc in bat hair, lead and some essential metals in liver, and iron and calcium in kidneys. Moreover, accumulation patterns in tissues differed depending on bat diet: insectivorous bats showed higher metal concentrations in fur than in liver and kidney while frugivorous species showed higher values in liver and kidney than in fur. Finally, among the bat species that have been studied in more than two papers, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) show values of mercury in hair and copper in liver that exceed the known thresholds; as does copper in the liver of the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus). Most studies have been conducted in temperate North America and Eurasia, areas with the lowest bat species diversity; there is a paucity of data on tropical bat species.

Besides sanguinivores, frugivores that use cluttered habitats and employ gleaning strategy showed larger pollex, whereas aerial insectivores that use open spaces presented smaller pollex. I found a negative relationship between pollex size and hand-wing length, but a positive relationship between pollex size and wing width. Results suggest a potential importance of the pollex on resource exploitation, especially in guilds associated to handling objects such as large fruits. Conversely, the pollex may be useless in aerial insectivores that employ other structures like uropatagium or dactylopatagium for prey capture and manipulation. The pollex is related to wing morphology and habitat use given that species with larger pollex and wide wings obtain their resources in cluttered habitats, while species with shorter pollex and longer wings acquire their preys over open spaces.

The number of captures divided by sampling effort, a proxy for abundance, varied from 0.000001 to 0.77 individuals·h−1·m−2 (0.04 ± 0.007 individuals·h−1·m−2). Our data set reveals a hyper-dominance of eight species that together that comprise 80% of all captures: Platyrrhinus lineatus (2.3%), Molossus molossus (2.8%), Artibeus obscurus (3.4%), Artibeus planirostris (5.2%), Artibeus fimbriatus (7%), Sturnira lilium (14.5%), Carollia perspicillata (15.6%), and Artibeus lituratus (29.2%).",2017,15/01/2024 16:28,08/01/2025 21:27,27/11/2024 20:20,3227-3227,,12,98,,,ATLANTIC BATS,,,,,,,en,© 2017 by the Ecological Society of America,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecy.2007,,C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\NJA6X5PM\Muylaert et al. - 2017 - ATLANTIC BATS a data set of bat communities from .pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\X5UNAPYZ\Muylaert et al. - 2017 - ATLANTIC BATS a data set of bat communities from the Atlantic Forests of South America.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\GTPB8XGC\ecy.html,,,biodiversity hotspot; Chiroptera; crop pest suppression; emerging diseases; forest fragmentation; hyper-dominance; mammal communities; mist nets; nutrient flux; Phyllostomidae; pollination; seed dispersal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, most data papers have focused on species occurrence or abundance, whereas interactions have received much less attention. To help fill this gap, we have compiled a georeferenced data set of interactions between 93 bat species of the family Phyllostomidae (Chiroptera) and 501 plant species of 68 families. Data came from 169 studies published between 1957 and 2007 covering the entire Neotropical Region, with most records from Brazil (34.5% of all study sites), Costa Rica (16%), and Mexico (14%). Our data set includes 2571 records of frugivory (75.1% of all records) and nectarivory (24.9%). The best represented bat genera are Artibeus (28% of all records), Carollia (24%), Sturnira (10.1%), and Glossophaga (8.8%). Carollia perspicillata (187), Artibeus lituratus (125), Artibeus jamaicensis (94), Glossophaga soricina (86), and Artibeus planirostris (74) were the bat species with the broadest diets recorded based on the number of plant species. Among the plants, the best represented families were Moraceae (17%), Piperaceae (15.4%), Urticaceae (9.2%), and Solanaceae (9%). Plants of the genera Cecropia (46), Ficus (42), Piper (40), Solanum (31), and Vismia (27) exhibited the largest number of interactions. These data are stored as arrays (records, sites, and studies) organized by logical keys and rich metadata, which helped to compile the information on different ecological and geographic scales, according to how they should be used. Our data set on bat-plant interactions is by far the most extensive, both in geographic and taxonomic terms, and includes abiotic information of study sites, as well as ecological information of plants and bats. It has already facilitated several studies and we hope it will stimulate novel analyses and syntheses, in addition to pointing out important gaps in knowledge.
