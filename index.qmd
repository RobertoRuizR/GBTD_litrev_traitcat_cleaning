title: "Global Bat Trait Database: Literature review and trait selection process"
---


This document compiles the code and data used for the literature review and functional trait selection process for the creation of a Global Bat Trait Database. This database is part of the first chapter of the PhD thesis "*Assessment of knowledge gaps in bats: A macroecological perspective*" which is being carried out by [Roberto Antonio Ruiz-Ramírez](https://maevolab.mx/authors/roberto/) at the [Evolutionary Macroecology Lab](https://maevolab.mx/). This chapter focuses on the assessment of knowledge gaps and biases in the available information on bat functional traits at a global level.

This repository is a work in progress maintained by Roberto A. Ruiz-Ramírez. If you have any questions or inquiries regarding the use of this document please write to: [roberto.ruiz\@posgrado.ecologia.edu.mx](mailto:roberto.ruiz@posgrado.ecologia.edu.mx)
