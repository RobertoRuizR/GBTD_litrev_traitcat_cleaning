# Literature review

The creation of the database described is done using "only" data found in secondary sources, such as databases and review articles. The reason is simple: There are *too many traits* for *too many bats*. The present review, and subsequent database, aims to be the next step in the trait-based approach for the study of bats proposed by Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres (2021). For example, several databases (e.g. ZooTraits; Gonçalvez-Souza et al., 2024*,* and ChiroVox; Görföl et al., 2022) are continuously updated and openly invite data integration from around the world. As such, this database will be easy to access and to update, as the final goal is to be a dynamic repository of bat tra

# Trait selection process

The total number of times a trait is represented is affected by the different ways in which each source describes it. For example, the trait "Mating systems" is represented in Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres (2021) as a categorical variable with 4 levels: Monogamic, Polygyny, Polyandry, and Promiscuty; however, Cosentino et al., (2023) has Monogamic, Polygyny, Polyandry, and Promiscuty as separate categorical variables, each with two levels: 1 = yes, 2 = no (Table 3). In this example, this results in a variable representing the same trait being counted 5 times.

-   In these cases, how should a variable be integrated into the database?

In the case of echolocation traits. Several data sources include echolocation variables such as: Frequency, number of harmonics, time in ms, and several other descriptors of any given echolocation pulse as separate traits. However, most bat calls repositories available online "only" have the .wav files reported for any given species or genus included (e.g. ChiroVox). This gives the flexibility to extract any bat call parameter from the actual .wav file. This is most likely the reason for the echolocation traits being underrepresented in the data sources consulted.

-   Given that the objective of the first chapter of this thesis is "to identify the gaps and biases in the knowledge of the functional traits of the order Chiroptera at a global level", how should these traits be integrated into the database?
