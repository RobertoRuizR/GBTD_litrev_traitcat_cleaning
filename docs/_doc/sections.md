In order to document the data manipulation pipeline, the files obtained and produced were organized in several folders:

-   *Data*: Contains the raw data used and the processed data obtained after manipulation.
-   *Metadata*: Contains the glossaries of column names and definitions used during the literature review and trait selection process.
-   *Output*: Contains tables and graphs generated.
-   *Scripts*: Contains the R scripts used for data manipulation as well as tables and graphs generation.
-   *References*: Contains the references obtained during the literature review and used during the trait selection process.

Each folder contains two sections: "*Literature review*" and "*Trait categories*".

-   *Literature review*: Search of the published data sources where bat functional traits are included.
-   *Trait categories*: This section includes the data and methodology used in order to compile, select, and clean the different functional traits to be evaluated.
