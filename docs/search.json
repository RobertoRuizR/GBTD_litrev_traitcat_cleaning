    "text": "Literature review\nA literature search of the Web of Science database and Google Scholar search engine was conducted on February, 2025, using the following keywords: (bat OR bats OR chiropter*) AND (review OR trait OR traits OR functional traits OR functional trait OR characteristic OR characteristics OR morphological OR life history). The literature search was not restricted in the date range and it included studies from 1966 up to 2025. Entries not related to bats were excluded from the search terms: (vaccines OR biomaterial OR bio-medical OR brown adipose tissue OR therapeutics OR biosynthesis). The first 300 listed results were inspected from the Web of Science and Google Scholar searches, as this number is also reported in published systematic reviews of bats (e.g. Crane et al., 2022) (Figure 1). The reference lists and supplementary information from relevant publications were also inspected (AfroBat, EuroBaTrait) for further relevant entries.\nThe inclusion criteria for entries considered was:\n\nMulti-taxa or bat-specific studies that included information on bat functional traits published on peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThis includes data papers, review articles, and case studies.\n\nMulti-taxa or bat-specific publications that included information on bat functional traits but were not published on peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThis includes online databases, books, book chapters, and reports.\n\nStudies published in the english or spanish languages.\n\n\nThe bat functional trait information available from the Handbook of Mammals of the World (Wilson & Mittermeier 2019, obtained from Sherman et al., 2024), as well as the Mammalian Species records, which are published by the American Society of Mammalogists, will also be obtained for integration into the database.\n\nEeach entry will be screened manually to identify publications reporting bat functional trait data. The following columns were added to the csv file for screening purposes.\n\nincludes_bats_in_title: Does the publication have the “bat” or any variation of the word in the title?\nincludes_traits_in_title: Does the publication have the “trait” or any variation of the word in the title?\nto_keep: Column to exclude duplicates, non english or spanish publications, not excluded by automatic tools. Also excludes publications not accessible for initial screening.\nincludes_trait_info: Does the publication include bat functional trait data?\nfully_included_in_another_source: Is the trait data fully obtained from any other study already included in the literature review?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "section": "Functional trait selection process",
    "text": "Functional trait selection process\nA total of 12 studies were screened for the selection of the functional traits to be evaluated (Table 1). The proposal for a trait-based approach for the study of bats (Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres 2021) was used as a baseline to define the trait types, complex or functional dimensions, and traits to be evaluated. Full citation data is contained in the bib/trait_categories folder as .bib, .csv and .docx files. Studies were included if they were:\n\nA multi-taxa compilation of functional trait data which includes bats.\nA bat-specific compilation of functional trait data.\nA dimension-specific compilation of bat functional trait data.\n\nIn addition to wing morphology traits, echolocation traits are also highly relevant for the study of bat ecology and conservation (Zamora et al., 2016; Zamora et al., 2020). However, the databases specialized for bat echolocation calls (e.g. ChiroVox; Görföl et al., 2022) usually contain the .wav files instead of the extracted parameters reported in other databases (e.g. frequency of the call, interpulse duration, pulse duration, among others). For this reason, such databases are not included in the studies screened for the trait selection process.\nThe trait description information (e.g. trait name, type of variable, description) was obtained from each study when available. Names and definitions for the trait descriptors were obtained from the Ecological Trait-data Standard (Schneider et al., 2019). For a detailed glossary of terms view metadata/trait_categories/trait_categories_glossary.xlsx.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Studies used for the selection of bat functional traits\n\n\nCitation\nTitle\nPublished in\n\n\n\n\nCastillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres, 2021\nOn the development of a trait-based approach for studying Neotropical bats\nPapéis Avulsos de Zoologia\n\n\nGonçalves-Souza et al., 2024\nZooTraits: An R shiny app for exploring animal trait data for ecological and evolutionary research\nEcology and Evolution\n\n\nSoria et al., 2021\nCOMBINE: a coalesced mammal database of intrinsic and extrinsic traits\nEcology\n\n\nCosentino et al., 2023\nA dataset on African bats’ functional traits\nScientific Data\n\n\nFroidevaux et al., 2023\nA species-level trait dataset of bats in Europe and beyond\nScientific Data\n\n\nCrane et al., 2021\nLimitations and gaps in global bat wing morphology trait data\nMammal Review\n\n\nMyhrvold et al., 2015\nAn amniote life‐history database to perform comparative analyses with birds, mammals, and reptiles: Ecological Archives E096‐269\nEcology\n\n\nGonçalves et al., 2018\nATLANTIC MAMMAL TRAITS: a data set of morphological traits of mammals in the Atlantic Forest of South America\nEcology\n\n\nTanalgo et al., 2022\nDarkCideS 1.0, a global database for bats in karsts and caves\nScientific Data\n\n\nWilkinson & South, 2002\nLife history, ecology and longevity in bats\nAging Cell\n\n\nHerberstein et al., 2022\nAnimalTraits - a curated animal trait database for body mass, metabolic rate and brain size\nScientific Data\n\n\nGeiselman & Ember, 2024\nBat Eco-Interactions — batbase.org\nbatbase.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOnce the trait descriptors from each study were obtained, the data sheets were combined by stacking the data on top of each other using the column names specified previously (Figure 2a). A new data sheet was generated where each row is a different functional trait and each column is a study (Figure 2b). If any given functional trait is included in two or more studies, they occupy the same row in a different column, each with the name assigned by the study indicated in the column header (Figure 2b). If any given trait is present in a study (Database A), but absent in another (Database B), the respective row in the Database B was left empty. Following this methodology, any additional functional trait reported in a study included afterwards will generate a new row without affecting the studies already included. The number of times in which any given trait was represented in all the studies was counted, and the descriptors of each trait were obtained from the first publication in which it was identified (Figure 2c).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Workflow for the screening and selection of bat functional traits to be evaluated. The first two columns in b) and c) correspond to trait type and the trait complex or functional dimension following Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres (2021).",

For example, several databases (e.g. ZooTraits; Gonçalvez-Souza et al., 2024, and ChiroVox; Görföl et al., 2022) are continuously updated and openly invite data integration from around the world. As such, this database will be easy to access and to update, as the final goal is to be a dynamic repository of bat traits.",

    "section": "Trait selection process",
    "text": "Trait selection process\nThe total number of times a trait is represented is affected by the different ways in which each source describes it. For example, the trait “Mating systems” is represented in Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres (2021) as a categorical variable with 4 levels: Monogamic, Polygyny, Polyandry, and Promiscuty; however, Cosentino et al., (2023) has Monogamic, Polygyny, Polyandry, and Promiscuty as separate categorical variables, each with two levels: 1 = yes, 2 = no (Table 3). In this example, this results in a variable representing the same trait being counted 5 times.\n\nIn these cases, how should a variable be integrated into the database?\n\nIn the case of echolocation traits. Several data sources include echolocation variables such as: Frequency, number of harmonics, time in ms, and several other descriptors of any given echolocation pulse as separate traits. However, most bat calls repositories available online “only” have the .wav files reported for any given species or genus included (e.g. ChiroVox). This gives the flexibility to extract any bat call parameter from the actual .wav file. This is most likely the reason for the echolocation traits being underrepresented in the data sources consulted.\n\nGiven that the objective of the first chapter of this thesis is “to identify the gaps and biases in the knowledge of the functional traits of the order Chiroptera at a global level”, how should these traits be integrated into the database?",
