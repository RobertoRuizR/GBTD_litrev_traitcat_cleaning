Desmodus rotundus               is one of only three mammal species known to feed exclusively on blood, mainly from domestic mammals, although large wildlife and occasionally humans can also serve as a food source. Blood feeding makes               D. rotundus               an effective transmissor of pathogens to its prey. Consequently, this species is a common target of culling efforts by various individuals and organizations. Nevertheless, little is known about the historical distribution of               D. rotundus               . Detailed occurrence data are critical for the accurate assessment of past and current distributions of               D. rotundus               as part of ecological, biogeographical, and epidemiological research.

Most emerging infectious disease agents in humans are of zoonotic origin. Bats are important reservoir hosts of many highly lethal zoonotic viruses and have been implicated in numerous emerging infectious disease events in recent years. It is essential to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the genetic diversity of the bat-associated viruses to prevent future outbreaks. To facilitate further research, we constructed the database of bat-associated viruses (DBatVir). Known viral sequences detected in bat samples were manually collected and curated, along with the related metadata, such as the sampling time, location, bat species and specimen type. Additional information concerning the bats, including common names, diet type, geographic distribution and phylogeny were integrated into the database to bridge the gap between virologists and zoologists. The database currently covers &gt;4100 bat-associated animal viruses of 23 viral families detected from 196 bat species in 69 countries worldwide. It provides an overview and snapshot of the current research regarding bat-associated viruses, which is essential now that the field is rapidly expanding. With a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, DBatVir provides a convenient and powerful platform for virologists and zoologists to analyze the virome diversity of bats, as well as for epidemiologists and public health researchers to monitor and track current and future bat-related infectious diseases.Database URL:http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir/",01/01/2014,14/11/2024 20:53,14/11/2024 20:53,14/11/2024 20:53,bau021,,,2014,,Database,DBatVir,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\JX654EL8\Chen et al. - 2014 - DBatVir the database of bat-associated viruses.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\529WPPE5\2633820.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bats and their ectoparasitic flies of the families Streblidae and Nycteribiidae are an excellent study model but, so far, our knowledge has been restricted to fragmented records at a local scale. To help boost research, we assembled a data set of bat–fly interactions from 174 studies published between 1904 and 2022 plus three original data sets. Altogether, these studies were carried out at 650 sites in the Neotropics, mainly distributed in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, southern USA, and Colombia, among other countries. In total, our data set contains 3984 interaction records between 237 bat species and 255 fly species. The bat species with the largest number of recorded interactions were Carollia perspicillata (357), Artibeus jamaicensis (263), and Artibeus lituratus (228). The fly species with the largest number of recorded interactions were Trichobius joblingi (256), Megistopoda aranea (235), and Megistopoda proxima (215). The interaction data were extracted, filtered, taxonomically harmonized, and made available in a tidy format together with linked data on bat population, fly population, study reference, sampling methods and geographic information from the study sites. This interconnected structure enables the expansion of information for each interaction record, encompassing where and how each interaction occurred, as well as the number of bats and flies involved. We expect BatFly to open new avenues for research focused on different levels of ecological organization and spatial scales. It will help consolidate knowledge about ecological specialization, resource distribution, pathogen transmission, and the drivers of parasite prevalence over a broad spatial range. It may also help to answer key questions such as: Are there differences in fly prevalence or mean infestation across Neotropical ecoregions? What ecological drivers explain those differences? How do specialization patterns vary among fly species in the Neotropics? Furthermore, we expect BatFly to inspire research aimed at understanding how climate and land-use changes may impact host–parasite interactions and disease outbreaks.

Here we provide updated distribution maps that comprise the extent of occurrence of the neotropical bat species in the superfamily Noctilionoidea (Mammalia: Chiroptera) after a thorough research of new records published between January 2008 and March 2018. The main motivation for this update was the inclusion of spatial and climatic variables in explaining the ecological and taxonomic diversity of noctilionoid bats. The core of the superfamily (246 species distributed in five families out of 250 species) occurs in the Neotropics and shows ecological diversity unparalleled among mammals. This clade also shows the only evolutionary shift towards higher speciation rates within the order Chiroptera. Updating the range maps for these bats resulted in the modification of maps of 94 species, and the creation of new maps for 37 species missing from the IUCN database. From the 94 modified maps, 55 species increased their latitudinal range and 38 increased their longitudinal range. These modifications did not change the overall extent of occurrence of the clade.

R.",NeoBat Interactions: A data set of bat-plant interactions in the Neotropics,Ecology,,1939-9170,10.1002/ecy.3640,,"Data papers and open databases have revolutionized contemporary science, as they provide the long-needed incentive to collaborate in large international teams and make natural history information widely available. Nevertheless, most data papers have focused on species occurrence or abundance, whereas interactions have received much less attention. To help fill this gap, we have compiled a georeferenced data set of interactions between 93 bat species of the family Phyllostomidae (Chiroptera) and 501 plant species of 68 families. Data came from 169 studies published between 1957 and 2007 covering the entire Neotropical Region, with most records from Brazil (34.5% of all study sites), Costa Rica (16%), and Mexico (14%). Our data set includes 2571 records of frugivory (75.1% of all records) and nectarivory (24.9%). The best represented bat genera are Artibeus (28% of all records), Carollia (24%), Sturnira (10.1%), and Glossophaga (8.8%). Carollia perspicillata (187), Artibeus lituratus (125), Artibeus jamaicensis (94), Glossophaga soricina (86), and Artibeus planirostris (74) were the bat species with the broadest diets recorded based on the number of plant species. Among the plants, the best represented families were Moraceae (17%), Piperaceae (15.4%), Urticaceae (9.2%), and Solanaceae (9%). Plants of the genera Cecropia (46), Ficus (42), Piper (40), Solanum (31), and Vismia (27) exhibited the largest number of interactions. These data are stored as arrays (records, sites, and studies) organized by logical keys and rich metadata, which helped to compile the information on different ecological and geographic scales, according to how they should be used. Our data set on bat-plant interactions is by far the most extensive, both in geographic and taxonomic terms, and includes abiotic information of study sites, as well as ecological information of plants and bats. It has already facilitated several studies and we hope it will stimulate novel analyses and syntheses, in addition to pointing out important gaps in knowledge.

Bats are a diverse group of mammals, with important roles in ecosystem functioning. However, our understanding of bats and their ecological importance is hindered by poorly defined ranges, mostly as a result of under-recording. This issue is exacerbated in Africa by the ongoing rapid discovery of new species, both de novo and splits of existing species, and by inaccessibility to museum specimens that are mostly hosted outside of the continent. Here we present the African bat database – a curated set of 17,285 unique locality records of all 266 species of bats from sub-Saharan Africa, vouched for by specimens and/or genetic sequencing, and aligned with current taxonomy. Based on these records, we also present Maxent-based distribution models and calculate the IUCN Red List metrics for Extent of Occurrence and Area of Occupancy. This database and online visualization tool provide an important open-source resource and is expected to significantly advance studies in ecology, and aid in bat conservation.",02/12/2024,04/12/2024 20:49,04/12/2024 20:49,04/12/2024 20:49,1309,,1,11,,Sci Data,African bat database,,,,,,,en,2024 The Author(s),,,,www.nature.com,,Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,"C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\A3BCFK92\Monadjem et al. - 2024 - African bat database curated data of occurrences, distributions and conservation metrics for sub-Sa.pdf",,,Conservation biology; Biodiversity; Taxonomy; Macroecology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
