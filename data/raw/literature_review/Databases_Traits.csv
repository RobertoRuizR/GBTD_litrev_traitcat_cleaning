Numerous works consider mean species-level measures of traits while ignoring individual variance within species. However, there is a large amount of variation within species and it is increasingly apparent that it is important to consider trait variation not only between species, but also within species. Mammals are an interesting group for investigating trait-based approaches because they play diverse and important ecological functions (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal, predation, grazing) that are correlated with functional traits. Here we compile a data set comprising morphological and life history information of 279 mammal species from 39,850 individuals of 388 populations ranging from −5.83 to −29.75 decimal degrees of latitude and −34.82 to −56.73 decimal degrees of longitude in the Atlantic forest of South America. We present trait information from 16,840 individuals of 181 species of non-volant mammals (Rodentia, Didelphimorphia, Carnivora, Primates, Cingulata, Artiodactyla, Pilosa, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla) and from 23,010 individuals of 98 species of volant mammals (Chiroptera). The traits reported include body mass, age, sex, reproductive stage, as well as the geographic coordinates of sampling for all taxa. Moreover, we gathered information on forearm length for bats and body length and tail length for rodents and marsupials. No copyright restrictions are associated with the use of this data set.

Currently, life-history data for amniotes (birds, mammals, and reptiles) are split among a variety of publicly available databases, data tables embedded in individual papers and books, and species-specific studies by experts. Using data from this wide range of sources is a challenge for conducting macroecological studies because of a lack of standardization in taxonomic classifications, parameter values, and even in which parameters are reported. In order to facilitate comparative analyses between amniote life-history data, we created a database compiled from peer-reviewed studies on individual species, macroecological studies of multiple species, existing life-history databases, and other aggregated sources as well as published books and other compilations. First, we extracted and aggregated the raw data from the aforementioned sources. Next, we resolved spelling errors and other formatting inconsistencies in species names through a number of computational and manual methods. Once this was completed, subspecies-level data and species-level data were shared via a data-sharing algorithm to accommodate the variety of species transformations (taxonomic promotions, demotions, merges, divergences, etc.) that have occurred over time. Finally, in species where multiple raw data points were identified for a given parameter, we report the median value. Here, we report a normalized and consolidated database of up to 29 life-history parameters, containing at least one life-history parameter for 21 322 species of birds, mammals, and reptiles.","2015","2024-09-06 18:08:27","2024-09-06 18:08:27","2024-09-06 18:08:27","3109-3109","","11","96","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/15-0846R.1","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\AH9HRTK5\Myhrvold et al. - 2015 - An amniote life-history database to perform comparative analyses with birds, mammals, and reptiles.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\A3V6WSWT\15-0846R.html","","","life history; mammals; macroecology; amniote; birds; body size; comparative analyses; database; reptiles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the number of recognized species in the class Mammalia has increased through time, tabulation of those increases has relied on the sporadic release of revisionary compendia like the Mammal Species of the World (MSW) series. Here, we present the Mammal Diversity Database (MDD), a digital, publically accessible, and updateable list of all mammalian species, now available online: https://mammaldiversity.org. The MDD will continue to be updated as manuscripts describing new species and higher taxonomic changes are released. Starting from the baseline of the 3rd edition of MSW (MSW3), we performed a review of taxonomic changes published since 2004 and digitally linked species names to their original descriptions and subsequent revisionary articles in an interactive, hierarchical database. The MDD provides the mammalogical community with an updateable online database of taxonomic changes, joining digital efforts already established for amphibians (AmphibiaWeb, AMNH’s Amphibian Species of the World), birds (e.g., Avibase, IOC World Bird List, HBW Alive), non-avian reptiles (The Reptile Database), and fish (e.g., FishBase, Catalog of Fishes). Development for this work is funded primarily by the American Society of Mammalogists (ASM; 2017-present), with initial logistical and planning support (2017-2019) provided by the NSF Vertlife Terrestrial grant. Logistical support is now also being provided by the Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center at Arizona State University. The ASM Biodiversity Committee compiles and maintains the MDD, curating regular releases that are downloadable in comma-delimited format. Downstream goals include expanded hosting of ecological, trait, and taxonomic data. Overall, this initiative aims to promote the ASM’s role as a leader in high quality research on mammalian biology. A new section on Subjective Decisions has been added to the MDD About page for use in summarizing opinion-based decisions of the MDD team that depart from the most recently published peer-reviewed article on a given taxon. Some of these decisions are made in collaboratoration with the Global Bat Taxonomy Working Group of the IUCN SSC Bat Specialist Group to promote harmonization between the MDD and batnames.org. Future subjective decisions will also be authored by the MDD Taxonomic Subcommittees that we are assembling in early 2024. Version 1.13 (13 July 2024). This is an incremental release that documents 6,753 total species, of which 113 are recently extinct (addition of 6 species since v1.12) and 6,640 are extant (17 domestic extant, 6,596 wild extant). There are still 27 species flagged for further review. The typeVoucher field (formerly called 'holotypeVoucher') is now filled for an incredible 5,801 accepted species, as compared to 2,727 species previously, thanks to the efforts of the MDD team with expanding the field to non-holotypes. The new field typeKind denotes which kind of type specimen is listed (e.g., holotype, lectotype, neotype, syntype). Also newly expanded is the direct link to authority species citations in the authoritySpeciesLink field — which went from 2,782 in the v1.12 to 6,057 links in the present version! The Tracked Differences file (""Diff_v1.12.1-v1.13.csv"") documents taxonomic changes made since the last MDD version, including 85 during the last 6 months (compares to 115 changes from v1.11-v1.12). Differences include 49 new species recognized (24 de novo, 25 split), 12 synonymizations (lumps), 2 species with genus name changes, 2 genus additions (Pudu to Pudella, Petinomys to Olisthomys), 2 species with epithet changes (based on priority/preoccupation), 12 species with epithet spelling changes (based on gender matching), and 2 species of Ctenomys that were removed due to unavailable names (to help flag that available names need to be proposed). In total, there was a net increase of 35 species and 2 genera of recognized extant or recently extinct mammals since MDD v1.12. Version 1.12.1 (30 January 2024). This is minor release that fixes a spelling error in a new species to Euryoryzomys cerqueirai (from E. cerqueriai). This version is also the first to display country-based maps on the per species pages as populated from the 'countryDistribution' field (e.g., see: https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#genus=Peromyscus&species=maniculatus&id=1002307). Thanks to Jorrit Poelen for some stellar work here! Version 1.12 (5 January 2024). This is an incremental release that documents 6,718 total species, of which 107 are recently extinct (addition of 2 species since v1.11) and 6,611 are extant (17 domestic extant, 6,567 wild extant). There are now 27 species flagged for further review. The holotypeVoucher field is filled for 2,727 accepted species thanks to the efforts of the MDD team (35 NA's indicate a real lack of actual voucher--in need of neotype). The Tracked Differences file (""Diff_v1.11-v1.12.csv"") documents taxonomic changes made since the last MDD version, which include 115 changes during the last 8 months (compares to 194 changes from v1.10-v1.11 and 117 changes from v1.9 to v1.10, and ~30 changes between versions before that). Differences include 77 new species recognized (38 de novo, 38 split, 1 revalidation), 8 synonymizations (lumps), 31 species with genus name changes, 7 genus additions (Bisbalus, Passalites, Subulo, Neoeptesicus, Mictomys, Cnephaeus, Cordimus) and 1 genus lump (Nesoromys), and 1 removed domestic species (Homo sapiens, given a revised MDD definition of domestication to be 'domesticated by human artificial selection'; see About page). In total, there was a net increase of 69 species and net increase of 6 genera of recognized extant or recently extinct mammals since MDD v1.11. Version 1.11 (15 April 2023). This is an incremental release that documents 6,649 total species, of which 105 are recently extinct (addition of 4 species since v1.10) and 6,544 are extant (18 domestic extant, 6,526 wild extant). There are now only 21 species flagged for further review. The holotypeVoucher field is filled for 2,731 accepted species thanks to the efforts of the MDD team (NA's indicate a real lack of actual voucher--in need of neotype). The Tracked Differences file (""Diff_v1.10-v1.11.csv"") documents taxonomic changes made since the last MDD version, which have been extensive recently due to enhanced activity, leading to a whopping 194 changes during the last 4 months (compares to 117 changes in the last version, and ~30 changes between previous versions). Differences include 64 new species recognized (15 de novo, 49 split), 29 synonymizations (lumps, including 2 domestic species: Bos domesticus into Bos javanicus, and Bos indicus into Bos taurus), 1 species removal (Makalata obscura, now considered nomen dubium), 36 species with genus name changes, 5 genus additions (Otohylomys, Baeodon, Neusticomys, Poecilictis, and Parachoerus) and 7 genus lumps (Crossogale, Aeorestes, Dasypterus, Koopmania, Pediolagus, Petropseudes, Catagonus), 5 species epithet changes to clear up confusion, 47 species epithet spelling changes to match gender or the original description (this was a major emphasis of this version– to come into harmony with batnames.org and hesperomys.com), and 1 error fix in the spelling of the common name ""Australian Humpback Dolphin"". In total, there was a net increase of 34 species and net decrease of 2 genera of recognized extant or recently extinct mammals since MDD v1.10. Version 1.10 (3 Dec 2022). This is an incremental release that documents 6,615 total species, of which 101 are recently extinct and 6,514 are extant (20 domestic extant, 6,494 wild extant). There are now 33 species flagged for further review (subtraction of Dromiciops mondaca, which was synonymized under D. gliroides). The holotypeVoucher field is now filled for 2,731 accepted species thanks to the continued efforts of Ingrid Rochon, Connor Burgin, and also now Bruce Patterson (NA's indicate a real lack of actual voucher--in need of neotype). The Tracked Differences file (""Diff_v1.9-v1.10.csv"") documents taxonomic changes made since the last MDD version, which was 8 months ago (1 April 2022) so 117 changes are included now versus the ~30 changes between previous versions. Differences include 49 new species recognized (22 de novo, 27 split), 30 synonymizations (lumps), 29 species with genus name changes (affecting Lissonycteris -> Myonycteris, Aonyx/Lutrogale -> Lutra, Eothenomys -> Anteliomys, Ellobius -> Bramus, Proedromys -> Mictomicrotus, Lasiopodomys back to Stenocranius, and Cephalophus -> Cephalophorus), 3 species epithet changes to clear up confusion, 5 species epithet spelling changes to match gender or the original description, and 1 error fix shifting Capra hircus to domestic status as the domestic form of C. aegagrus. In total, there was a net increase of 19 species and 5 genera of recognized extant or recently extinct mammals since MDD v1.9. Version 1.9.1 (29 Jun 2022). This is a patch release that adds the field 'holotypeVoucherURIs' to the MDD taxonomy file for use in linking the type specimens to external website(s), including the hosting museum collection. Currently this feature is experimental. The taxonomy still includes 6,596 total species, of which 101 are recently extinct & 6,495 are extant (19 domestic extant, 6,476 wild extant). Version 1.9 (1 Apr 2022). This is an incremental release that documents 6,596 total species, of which 101 are recently extinct and 6,495 are extant (19 domestic extant, 6,476 wild extant). There are now 34 species flagged for further review (addition of 6 species related to the split of Lagenorhynchus dolphins, along with the previous inclusion of some Cebus species). The holotypeVoucher field is now filled for 2,662 accepted species thanks to the continued efforts of Ingrid Rochon and Connor Burgin (NA's indicate a real lack of actual voucher--in need of neotype). The Tracked Differences file (""Diff_v1.8-v1.9.csv"") documents taxonomic changes made since the last MDD version, and here includes 15 new species recognized (8 de novo, 7 split), 10 synonymizations (lumps), 2 species with genus name changes (Brachylagus idahoensis to Sylvilagus idahoensis and Nycticebus pygmaeus to Xanthonycticebus pygmaeus), and 1 range extension (for Marmosa alstoni extended to Panama; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6374907). In total, there was a net increase of 5 recognized species of extant or recently extinct mammals since MDD v1.8. Version 1.8 (1 Feb 2022). This is an incremental release that documents 6,591 total species, of which 101 are recently extinct and 6,490 are extant (19 domestic extant, 6,471 wild extant). There are still 28 species flagged for further review (e.g., some Cebus species). The holotypeVoucher field is now filled for 2,665 accepted species thanks to the continued efforts of Ingrid Rochon and Connor Burgin (NA's indicate a real lack of actual voucher--in need of neotype). The Tracked Differences file (""Diff_v1.7-v1.8.csv"") documents taxonomic changes made since the last MDD version, and here includes 27 new species recognized (21 de novo, 6 split), 3 synonymizations, 1 genus change (Nasuella into Nasua, resulting in a reduction in the total number of genera), and 3 species name changes (2 based on new genetic evidence and naming priority, 1 on a spelling change). In total, there was a net increase of 24 recognized species of extant or recently extinct mammals since MDD v1.7. Version 1.7 (6 Nov 2021). This is an incremental release that documents 6,567 total species, of which 101 are recently extinct and 6,466 are extant (19 domestic extant, 6,447 wild extant). There are now 28 species flagged for further review (e.g., some Cebus species). The holotypeVoucher field is now filled for 2,512 accepted species thanks to the continued efforts of Ingrid Rochon and Connor Burgin (including a reduction of NA's from 103 to 26). The Tracked Differences file (""Diff_v1.6-v1.7.csv"") documents taxonomic changes made since the last MDD version, and here includes 19 new species recognized (13 de novo, 6 split), 9 synonymizations, 12 genus changes, and 2 de-extinctions due to taxonomic changes (extinct Gazella bilkis synonymized under extant Gazella arabica following Bärmann et al. 2013; extinct Pseudomys gouldii changed to extant since extant Pseudomys fieldi was synonymized under it in the MDD v1.6 following Roycroft et al. 2021). In total, there was a net increase of 10 recognized species of extant or recently extinct mammals since MDD v1.6. Version 1.6 (10 Aug 2021). This is an incremental release that documents 6,557 total species, of which 103 are recently extinct and 6,454 are extant (19 domestic extant, 6,435 wild extant). There are 29 species still flagged for further review (e.g., some Cebus species). The holotypeVoucher field is now filled for 2,548 accepted species thanks to the continued efforts of Ingrid Rochon. The Tracked Differences file (""Diff_v1.5-v1.6.csv"") documents taxonomic changes made since the last MDD version, and here includes 9 new species recognized (5 de novo, 4 split), 5 synonymizations, 1 removal (Dryomys yarkandensis invalid while in pre-print), and 18 genus changes. Version 1.5 (11 Jun 2021). This is an incremental release that documents 6,554 total species, of which 103 are recently extinct and 6,451 are extant (19 domestic extant, 6,432 wild extant). There are 29 species still flagged for further review (e.g., some Cebus species). The holotypeVoucher field, which now filled for 2,459 accepted species thanks to the continued efforts of Ingrid Rochon. We also continue to maintain the Tracked Differences file (""Diff_v1.4-v1.5.csv"") which documents which taxonomic changes were made per species since the last MDD version. We still plan to retrospectively assemble these diff files for previous versions as well. Version 1.4 (11 Apr 2021). This is an incremental release that documents 6,533 total species, of which 103 are recently extinct, 19 are domestic extant, and 6,411 are wild extant. There are 29 species still flagged for further review (e.g., some Cebus species). Especially improved in this version is the holotypeVoucher field, which now filled for 2,153 accepted species thanks to the heroic efforts of Ingrid Rochon (nearly 1/3 of mammals!!). Additionally, this time we added a Tracked Differences file (""Diff_v1.31-v1.4.csv"") which documents which taxonomic changes were made per species since the last MDD version. We plan to retrospectively assemble these diff files for previous versions as well. Note also that the per-species notes (taxonomyNotes) are now updated through all mammals including Chiroptera thanks to the careful efforts of David Huckaby and Connor Burgin. Those notes should help clarify changes since MSW3, which is the well-recognized baseline for mammal taxonomy from which the MDD is updating. Version 1.3.1 (8 Jan 2021). This is an patch release that, like v1.3, documents 6,513 total species, but also (i) fixes some bugs in the type locality listings; and (ii) completes the improved documentation in the per-species notes across all orders including Chiroptera (carefully curated by David Huckaby and Connor Burgin; thanks both!). These completed notes clarify changes since MSW3, which is the well-recognized baseline for mammal taxonomy from which the MDD is updating. Version 1.3 (28 Dec 2020). This is an incremental release that documents 6,513 total species, of which 103 are recently extinct, 19 are domestic extant, and 6,391 are wild extant. There are 29 species still flagged for further review (e.g., some Cebus species). Especially improved in this version are the per-species notes, which have been carefully curated by David Huckaby and Connor Burgin for all mammal orders except Chiroptera (expect those updates in the next version). These notes were written to help clarify changes since MSW3, which is the well-recognized baseline for mammal taxonomy from which the MDD is updating. Version 1.2 (24 Sep 2020). This is a major update, though still incremental toward a more definitive forthcoming release. This release documents 6,485 total species, of which 103 are recently extinct, 19 are domestic extant, and 6,363 are wild extant. Ten species are still ""flagged"" for further review. This taxonomy and associated data (type locality, authorities, common names) are improved by reference to the Handbook of the Mammals of the World series. Additionally, justifications and citations are now provided for any subjective decisions made, the most substantial of which has been the recommendations of Groves and Grubb (2011)’s compendium Ungulate Taxonomy. That taxonomy of Perissodactyla and non-cetacean Artiodactyla was fully included in the v1.0 release of the MDD (Burgin et al. 2018). However, since Groves and Grubb (2011) was based primarily on qualitative morphological diagnoses with small sample sizes, it has since become controversial in the mammalogical community (e.g., (Holbrook 2013; Gutiérrez and Garbino 2018)). Many specialists have subsequently reverted to the taxonomic arrangement presented by Peter Grubb in MSW3. In current versions of the MDD, we use MSW3 as a baseline for ungulate taxonomy, leaving out all changes made by Groves and Grubb (2011) with the exception of those supported by other published research. Note: this MDD v1.2 taxonomy is also paired with species-level geographic range maps for 6,362 species, available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6644198 as mirrored from the data publication of Marsh et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14330). This range map data set differs from the 6,485 total species in MDD v1.2, as follows: excludes all recently extinct (103) and domestic species (20; correcting for Capra hircus that was coded as 'domestic=0' rather than 'domestic=1' originally); excludes 2 species for which no spatial information was available (Nycticeius aenobarbus and Phoniscus aerosus); and includes 2 species (Elaphurus davidianus and Oryx dammah) that are extinct in the wild (EW) in IUCN, but which have recent range information and were coded in the MDD as extant. Version 1.1 (29 Mar 2019). This is an incremental release that documents 6,526 total species, of which 100 are recently extinct, 17 are domestic extant, and 6,409 are wild extant.  Of those, 212 species are ""flagged"" for further review (mostly ungulates from Groves & Grubb, 2011). Version 1.0 (1 Feb 2018; described in https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyx147). We found 6,495 species of currently recognized mammals (96 recently extinct, 6,399 extant), compared to 5,416 in MSW3 (75 extinct, 5,341 extant)—an increase of 1,079 species in about 13 years, including 11 species newly described as having gone extinct in the last 500 years. We tabulate 1,251 new species recognitions, at least 172 unions, and multiple major, higher-level changes, including an additional 88 genera (1,314 now, compared to 1,226 in MSW3) and 14 newly recognized families (167 compared to 153). Analyses of the description of new species through time and across biogeographic regions show a long-term global rate of ~25 species recognized per year, with the Indomalayan biogeographic region as the overall most species-dense for mammals globally (127.1 species/km2), followed by Australasia-Oceania (90.6) and the Neotropics (85.1).   References   BURGIN, C.

For plants, the TRY database has been an unwavering success for those ecologists interested in addressing how plant traits influence a wide variety of processes and patterns, but the same is not true for most animal taxonomic groups. Here, we introduce ZooTraits, a Shiny app designed to help users explore and obtain animal trait data for research in ecology and evolution. ZooTraits was developed to tackle the challenge of finding in a single site information of multiple trait datasets and facilitating access to traits by providing an easy-to-use, open-source platform. This app combines datasets centralized in the Open Trait Network, raw data from the AnimalTraits database, and trait information for animals compiled by Gonçalves-Souza et al. (2023, Ecology and Evolution 13, e10016). Importantly, the ZooTraits app can be accessed freely and provides a user-friendly interface through three functionalities that will allow users to easily visualize, compare, download, and upload trait data across the animal tree of life—ExploreTrait, FeedTrait, and GetTrait. By using ExploreTrait and GetTrait, users can explore, compare, and extract 3954 trait records from 23,394 species centralized in the Open Traits Network, and trait data for 2000 species from the AnimalTraits database. The app summarizes trait information for numerous taxonomic groups within the Animal Kingdom, encompassing data from diverse aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and various geographic regions worldwide. Moreover, ZooTraits enables researchers to upload trait information, serving as a hub for a continually expanding global trait database. By promoting the centralization of trait datasets and offering a platform for data sharing, ZooTraits is facilitating advancements in trait-based ecological and evolutionary studies. We hope that other trait databases will evolve to mirror the approach we have outlined here.","2024","2024-09-06 16:35:02","2024-09-06 16:35:14","2024-09-06 16:35:02","e11334","","5","14","","","ZooTraits","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Authors.

Nevertheless, the Raunkiæran shortfall—the dearth of knowledge on species traits and their functionality—presents a challenge in the application of these approaches. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the trends and gaps in trait-based animal ecology in terms of taxonomic resolution, trait selection, ecosystem type, and geographical region. In addition, we suggest a set of crucial steps to guide trait selection and aid future research to conduct within and cross-taxon comparisons. We identified 1655 articles using virtually all animal groups published from 1999 to 2020. Studies were concentrated in vertebrates, terrestrial habitats, the Palearctic realm, and mostly investigated trophic and habitat dimensions. Additionally, they focused on response traits (79.4%) and largely ignored intraspecific variation (94.6%). Almost 36% of the data sets did not provide the rationale behind the selection of morphological traits. The main limitations of trait-based animal ecology were the use of trait averages and a rare inclusion of intraspecific variability. Nearly one-fifth of the studies based only on response traits conclude that trait diversity impacts ecosystem processes or services without justifying the connection between them or measuring them. We propose a guide for standardizing trait collection that includes the following: (i) determining the type of trait and the mechanism linking the trait to the environment, ecosystem, or the correlation between the environment, trait, and ecosystem, (ii) using a “periodic table of niches” to select the appropriate niche dimension to support a mechanistic trait selection, and (iii) selecting the relevant traits for each retained niche dimension. By addressing these gaps, trait-based animal ecology can become more predictive. This implies that future research will likely focus on collaborating to understand how environmental changes impact animals and their capacity to provide ecosystem services and goods.","2023","2024-09-06 16:19:05","2025-01-10 22:15:10","2024-09-06 16:19:05","e10016","","4","13","","","Bringing light onto the Raunkiæran shortfall","","","","","","","en","© 2023 The Authors.

Currently, trait data can be found across a wide variety of data sets included in websites, articles, and books, each one with its own taxonomic classification, set of traits, and data management methodology. Mammals, in particular, are among the most studied taxa, with large sources of trait information readily available. To facilitate the use of these data, we did an extensive review of published mammal trait data sources between 1999 and May 2020 and produced COMBINE: a COalesced Mammal dataBase of INtrinsic and Extrinsic traits. Our aim was to create a taxonomically integrated database of mammal traits that maximized trait number and coverage without compromising data quality. COMBINE contains information on 54 traits for 6,234 extant and recently extinct mammal species, including information on morphology, reproduction, diet, biogeography, life habit, phenology, behavior, home range, and density. Additionally, we calculated other relevant traits such as habitat and altitudinal breadths for all species and dispersal for terrestrial non-volant species. All data are compatible with the taxonomies of the IUCN Red List v. 2020-2 and PHYLACINE v. 1.2. Missing data were adequately flagged and imputed for non-biogeographical traits with 20% or more data available. We obtained full data sets for 21 traits such as female maturity, litter size, maximum longevity, trophic level, and dispersal, providing imputation performance statistics for all. This data set will be especially useful for those interested in including species’ traits in large-scale ecological and conservation analyses.

Using this prediction, we selected six life history and ecological factors to use in a comparative analysis of longevity among 64 bat species. On average, the maximum recorded life span of a bat is 3.5 times greater than a non-flying placental mammal of similar size. Records of individuals surviving more than 30 years in the wild now exist for five species. Univariate and multivariate analyses of species data, as well as of phylogenetically independent contrasts obtained using a supertree of Chiroptera, reveal that bat life span significantly increases with hibernation, body mass and occasional cave use, but decreases with reproductive rate and is not influenced by diet, colony size or the source of the record. These results are largely consistent with extrinsic mortality risk acting as a determinant of bat longevity. Nevertheless, the strong association between life span and both reproductive rate and hibernation also suggests that bat longevity is strongly influenced by seasonal allocation of non-renewable resources to reproduction. We speculate that hibernation may provide a natural example of caloric restriction, which is known to increase longevity in other mammals.","2002","2024-10-07 20:51:52","2024-10-07 20:51:52","2024-10-07 20:51:52","124-131","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00020.x","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\27AYRJ3K\Wilkinson and South - 2002 - Life history, ecology and longevity in bats.pdf","","","life history; hibernation; life span; reproductive effort; roost; senescence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the numerous ontologies available, one area currently lacking a robust ontology is the description of vertebrate traits. A trait is defined as any measurable or observable characteristic pertaining to an organism or any of its substructures. While there are several ontologies to describe entities and processes in phenotypes, diseases, and clinical measurements, one has not been developed for vertebrate traits; the Vertebrate Trait Ontology (VT) was created to fill this void. DESCRIPTION: Significant inconsistencies in trait nomenclature exist in the literature, and additional difficulties arise when trait data are compared across species. The VT is a unified trait vocabulary created to aid in the transfer of data within and between species and to facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of traits. Trait information provides a valuable link between the measurements that are used to assess the trait, the phenotypes related to the traits, and the diseases associated with one or more phenotypes. Because multiple clinical and morphological measurements are often used to assess a single trait, and a single measurement can be used to assess multiple physiological processes, providing investigators with standardized annotations for trait data will allow them to investigate connections among these data types. CONCLUSIONS: The annotation of genomic data with ontology terms provides unique opportunities for data mining and analysis. Links between data in disparate databases can be identified and explored, a strategy that is particularly useful for cross-species comparisons or in situations involving inconsistent terminology. The VT provides a common basis for the description of traits in multiple vertebrate species. It is being used in the Rat Genome Database and Animal QTL Database for annotation of QTL data for rat, cattle, chicken, swine, sheep, and rainbow trout, and in the Mouse Phenome Database to annotate strain characterization data. In these databases, data are also cross-referenced to applicable terms from other ontologies, providing additional avenues for data mining and analysis.

To fill this gap, we compiled morphological traits related to locomotion and feeding for the world freshwater fish fauna based on pictures and scientific drawings available from the literature. Main types of variables contained The database includes 10 morphological traits measured on 8,342 freshwater fish species, covering 48.69% of the world freshwater fish fauna. Spatial location and grain Global. Major taxa and level of measurement The database considers ray-finned fishes (class Actinopterygii). Measurements were made at the species level. Software format .csv. Main conclusion The FISHMORPH database provides the most comprehensive database on fish morphological traits to date. It represents an essential source of information for ecologists and environmental managers seeking to consider morphological patterns of fish faunas throughout the globe, and for those interested in current and future impacts of human activities on the morphological structure of fish assemblages. Given the high threat status of freshwater environments and the biodiversity they host, we believe this database will be of great interest for future studies on freshwater ecology research and conservation.","2021","2024-09-12 18:08:09","2024-09-12 18:08:09","2024-09-12 18:08:09","2330-2336","","12","30","","","FISHMORPH","","","","","","","en","© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.13395","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\BZKQQVYR\Brosse et al. - 2021 - FISHMORPH A global database on morphological traits of freshwater fishes.pdf","","","conservation; biodiversity; functional traits; Actinopterygii; body shape; eye size; feeding; fin size; locomotion; mouth size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phylogenies, range data, and trait data often use conflicting taxonomies and require ad hoc decisions to synonymize species or fill in large amounts of missing data. Furthermore, most available data sets ignore the large impact that humans have had on species ranges and diversity. Ignoring these impacts can lead to drastic differences in diversity patterns and estimates of the strength of biological rules. To help overcome these issues, we assembled               PHYLACINE               , The Phylogenetic Atlas of Mammal Macroecology. This taxonomically integrated platform contains phylogenies, range maps, trait data, and threat status for all 5,831 known mammal species that lived since the last interglacial (~130,000 years ago until present).               PHYLACINE               is ready to use directly, as all taxonomy and metadata are consistent across the different types of data, and files are provided in easy‐to‐use formats. The atlas includes both maps of current species ranges and present natural ranges, which represent estimates of where species would live without anthropogenic pressures. Trait data include body mass and coarse measures of life habit and diet. Data gaps have been minimized through extensive literature searches and clearly labelled imputation of missing values. The               PHYLACINE               database will be archived here as well as hosted online so that users may easily contribute updates and corrections to continually improve the data. This database will be useful to any researcher who wishes to investigate large‐scale ecological patterns. Previous versions of the database have already provided valuable information and have, for instance, shown that megafauna extinctions caused substantial changes in vegetation structure and nutrient transfer patterns across the globe.","2018-11","2024-01-17 22:07:38","2024-01-17 22:07:38","2024-01-17 22:07:38","2626-2626","","11","99","","Ecology","<span style=""font-variant","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\7NIBKG9T\Faurby et al. - 2018 - PHYLACINE.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attributes such as diet, foraging strata, foraging time, and body size, in particular, characterize a large portion of the “Eltonian” niches of species. Here we present a global species-level compilation of these key attributes for all 9993 and 5400 extant bird and mammal species derived from key literature sources. Global handbooks and monographs allowed the consistent sourcing of attributes for most species. For diet and foraging stratum we followed a defined protocol to translate the verbal descriptions into standardized, semiquantitative information about relative importance of different categories. Together with body size (continuous) and activity time (categorical) this enables a much finer distinction of species' foraging ecology than typical categorical guild assignments allow. Attributes lacking information for specific species are flagged, and interpolated values based on taxonomy are provided instead. The presented data set is limited by, among others, these select cases missing observed data, by errors and uncertainty in the expert assessment as presented in the literature, and by the lack of intraspecific information. However, the standardized and transparent nature and complete global coverage of the data set should support an array of potential studies in biogeography, community ecology, macroevolution, global change biology, and conservation. Potential uses include comparative work involving these traits as focal or secondary variables, ecological research on the trait or trophic structure of communities, or conservation science concerned with the loss of function among species or in ecosystems in a changing world. We hope that this publication will spur the sharing, collaborative curation, and extension of data to the benefit of a more integrative, rigorous, and global biodiversity science.","2014","2024-01-15 16:38:15","2024-01-15 16:38:20","2024-01-15 16:38:15","2027-2027","","7","95","","","EltonTraits 1.0","","","","","","","en","© 2014 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/13-1917.1","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\XPWINCYQ\Wilman et al. - 2014 - EltonTraits 1.0 Species-level foraging attributes.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\4SZRA8GI\13-1917.html","","","traits; diet; body size; function; bird; eco-informatics; foraging; mammal; mass; niche; stratum; vertebrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Desmodus rotundus               is one of only three mammal species known to feed exclusively on blood, mainly from domestic mammals, although large wildlife and occasionally humans can also serve as a food source. Blood feeding makes               D. rotundus               an effective transmissor of pathogens to its prey. Consequently, this species is a common target of culling efforts by various individuals and organizations. Nevertheless, little is known about the historical distribution of               D. rotundus               .

Most emerging infectious disease agents in humans are of zoonotic origin. Bats are important reservoir hosts of many highly lethal zoonotic viruses and have been implicated in numerous emerging infectious disease events in recent years. It is essential to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the genetic diversity of the bat-associated viruses to prevent future outbreaks. To facilitate further research, we constructed the database of bat-associated viruses (DBatVir). Known viral sequences detected in bat samples were manually collected and curated, along with the related metadata, such as the sampling time, location, bat species and specimen type. Additional information concerning the bats, including common names, diet type, geographic distribution and phylogeny were integrated into the database to bridge the gap between virologists and zoologists. The database currently covers &gt;4100 bat-associated animal viruses of 23 viral families detected from 196 bat species in 69 countries worldwide. It provides an overview and snapshot of the current research regarding bat-associated viruses, which is essential now that the field is rapidly expanding. With a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, DBatVir provides a convenient and powerful platform for virologists and zoologists to analyze the virome diversity of bats, as well as for epidemiologists and public health researchers to monitor and track current and future bat-related infectious diseases.Database URL:http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir/","2014-01-01","2024-11-14 20:53:01","2024-11-14 20:53:09","2024-11-14 20:53:01","bau021","","","2014","","Database","DBatVir","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\JX654EL8\Chen et al. - 2014 - DBatVir the database of bat-associated viruses.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\529WPPE5\2633820.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Records of frugivory from over 75 countries are presented for 260 Ficus species (approximately 30% of described species). Explanations are presented for geographical and taxonomic gaps in the otherwise extensive literature. In addition to a small number of reptiles and fishes, 1274 bird and mammal species in 523 genera and 92 families are known to eat figs. In terms of the number of species and genera of fig-eaters and the number of fig species eaten we identify the avian families interacting most with Ficus to be Columbidae, Psittacidae, Pycnonotidae, Bucerotidae, Sturnidae and Lybiidae. Among mammals, the major fig-eating families are Pteropodidae, Cercopithecidae, Sciuridae, Phyllostomidae and Cebidae. We assess the role these and other frugivores play in Ficus seed dispersal and identify fig-specialists. In most, but not all, cases fig specialists provide effective seed dispersal services to the Ficus species on which they feed. The diversity of fig-eaters is explained with respect to fig design and nutrient content, phenology of fig ripening and the diversity of fig presentation. Whilst at a gross level there exists considerable overlap between birds, arboreal mammals and fruit bats with regard to the fig species they consume, closer analysis, based on evidence from across the tropics, suggests that discrete guilds of Ficus species differentially attract subsets of sympatric frugivore communities. This dispersal guild structure is determined by interspecific differences in fig design and presentation. Throughout our examination of the fig-frugivore interaction we consider phylogenetic factors and make comparisons between large-scale biogeographical regions. Our dataset supports previous claims that Ficus is the most important plant genus for tropical frugivores. We explore the concept of figs as keystone resources and suggest criteria for future investigations of their dietary importance. Finally, fully referenced lists of frugivores recorded at each Ficus species and of Ficus species in the diet of each frugivore are presented as online appendices. In situations where ecological information is incomplete or its retrieval is impractical, this valuable resource will assist conservationists in evaluating the role of figs or their frugivores in tropical forest sites.","2001","2024-11-20 21:14:18","2024-11-20 21:14:21","2024-11-20 21:14:18","529-572","","4","76","","","Fig-eating by vertebrate frugivores","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1017/S1464793101005760","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\7URUFZKD\Shanahan et al. - 2001 - Fig-eating by vertebrate frugivores a global review.pdf","","","frugivory; Ficus; fruit syndromes; keystone resources; seed dispersal guilds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing global databases of species’ threat status or population time series are dominated by charismatic species. The collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and biogeographic extents, and that support computation of a range of biodiversity indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of historical declines and to project – and avert – future declines. We describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6 million samples from 78 countries representing over 28,000 species, collated from existing spatial comparisons of local-scale biodiversity exposed to different intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites around the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of 814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity hotspots and 16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more than 1% of the total number of all species described, and more than 1% of the described species within many taxonomic groups – including flowering plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles, lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added to, is therefore already considerably larger and more representative than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends and responses.

For animals, diet represents a fundamental aspect of species’ evolutionary adaptations, ecological and functional roles, and trophic interactions. However, the importance of diet for macroevolutionary and macroecological dynamics remains little explored, partly because of the lack of comprehensive trait datasets. We compiled and evaluated a comprehensive global dataset of diet preferences of mammals (“MammalDIET”). Diet information was digitized from two global and cladewide data sources and errors of data entry by multiple data recorders were assessed. We then developed a hierarchical extrapolation procedure to fill-in diet information for species with missing information. Missing data were extrapolated with information from other taxonomic levels (genus, other species within the same genus, or family) and this extrapolation was subsequently validated both internally (with a jack-knife approach applied to the compiled species-level diet data) and externally (using independent species-level diet information from a comprehensive continentwide data source). Finally, we grouped mammal species into trophic levels and dietary guilds, and their species richness as well as their proportion of total richness were mapped at a global scale for those diet categories with good validation results. The success rate of correctly digitizing data was 94%, indicating that the consistency in data entry among multiple recorders was high. Data sources provided species-level diet information for a total of 2033 species (38% of all 5364 terrestrial mammal species, based on the IUCN taxonomy). For the remaining 3331 species, diet information was mostly extrapolated from genus-level diet information (48% of all terrestrial mammal species), and only rarely from other species within the same genus (6%) or from family level (8%). Internal and external validation showed that: (1) extrapolations were most reliable for primary food items; (2) several diet categories (“Animal”, “Mammal”, “Invertebrate”, “Plant”, “Seed”, “Fruit”, and “Leaf”) had high proportions of correctly predicted diet ranks; and (3) the potential of correctly extrapolating specific diet categories varied both within and among clades. Global maps of species richness and proportion showed congruence among trophic levels, but also substantial discrepancies between dietary guilds. MammalDIET provides a comprehensive, unique and freely available dataset on diet preferences for all terrestrial mammals worldwide. It enables broad-scale analyses for specific trophic levels and dietary guilds, and a first assessment of trait conservatism in mammalian diet preferences at a global scale. The digitalization, extrapolation and validation procedures could be transferable to other trait data and taxa.","2014","2024-10-07 22:47:07","2025-01-10 22:29:37","2024-11-21 21:39:48","2913-2930","","14","4","","","Establishing macroecological trait datasets","","","","","","","en","© 2014 The Authors.

However, the overwhelming majority of studies examining this relationship have used basal or resting metabolic rates, and/or have used data consisting of species-averaged masses and metabolic rates. Field metabolic rates are more ecologically relevant and are probably more directly subject to natural selection than basal rates. Individual rates might be more important than species-average rates in determining the outcome of ecological interactions, and hence selection. We here provide the first comprehensive database of published field metabolic rates and body masses of individual birds and mammals, containing measurements of 1498 animals of 133 species in 28 orders. We used linear mixed-effects models to answer questions about the body mass scaling of metabolic rate and its taxonomic universality/heterogeneity that have become classic areas of controversy. Our statistical approach allows mean scaling exponents and taxonomic heterogeneity in scaling to be analysed in a unified way while simultaneously accounting for nonindependence in the data due to shared evolutionary history of related species. The mean power-law scaling exponents of metabolic rate vs. body mass relationships were 0·71 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 0·625–0·795] for birds and 0·64 (95% CI 0·564–0·716) for mammals. However, these central tendencies obscured meaningful taxonomic heterogeneity in scaling exponents. The primary taxonomic level at which heterogeneity occurred was the order level. Substantial heterogeneity also occurred at the species level, a fact that cannot be revealed by species-averaged data sets used in prior work. Variability in scaling exponents at both order and species levels was comparable to or exceeded the differences 3/4−2/3 = 1/12 and 0·71−0·64. Results are interpreted in the light of a variety of existing theories. In particular, results are consistent with the heat dissipation theory of Speakman & Król (2010) and provided some support for the metabolic levels boundary hypothesis of Glazier (2010). Our analysis provides the first comprehensive empirical analysis of the scaling relationship between field metabolic rate and body mass in individual birds and mammals. Our data set is a valuable contribution to those interested in theories of the allometry of metabolic rates.","2013","2024-09-12 18:22:18","2024-11-22 19:25:36","2024-11-21 21:50:18","1009-1020","","5","82","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2013 The Authors.

It has long been known that the Atlantic Forest has one of the most diversified biotas on the planet, presenting high levels of endemism. Here, we update the knowledge regarding terrestrial vertebrates occurring in the Atlantic Forest, focusing on endemic species and presenting its main spatial patterns of diversity. We also analyzed the main knowledge gaps associated with these species. We identified 2,645 species of Tetrapoda in the Atlantic Forest, being 719 species of amphibians, 517 species of reptiles, 1,025 species of birds, and 384 species of mammals. The uniqueness of its fauna is impressive even in a global scale, as 2.8% of the world’s Tetrapoda species occurs only in the Atlantic Forest. For reptiles, this percentage is 1.3%, while for both birds and mammals, it hovers around 1.9%, but for amphibians, it reaches an impressive 6.6%. Spatially, most groups exhibit their highest species richness at the core of the Atlantic Forest, and this pattern becomes more evident when only endemic species are considered. Even with all its impressive diversity, 157 new Tetrapoda species were described in the Atlantic Forest in the last decade, mostly from poorly sampled regions or environments. An increase of sampling effort on these regions might increase the number of species on this biome, which already is one of the most diverse in the world.","2021","2024-01-29 21:23:09","2024-11-22 19:25:34","2024-11-21 22:07:57","185-204","","","","","","Tetrapod Diversity in the Atlantic Forest","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-55322-7_9","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\FCVMQVWP\Figueiredo et al. - 2021 - Tetrapod Diversity in the Atlantic Forest Maps an.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\G6MT7QTB\Figueiredo et al. - 2021 - Tetrapod Diversity in the Atlantic Forest Maps and Gaps.pdf","","","Wallacean shortfall; Richness; Linnean shortfall; Endemism; Spatial patterns","Marques, Marcia C.

Bats and their ectoparasitic flies of the families Streblidae and Nycteribiidae are an excellent study model but, so far, our knowledge has been restricted to fragmented records at a local scale. To help boost research, we assembled a data set of bat–fly interactions from 174 studies published between 1904 and 2022 plus three original data sets. Altogether, these studies were carried out at 650 sites in the Neotropics, mainly distributed in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, southern USA, and Colombia, among other countries. In total, our data set contains 3984 interaction records between 237 bat species and 255 fly species. The bat species with the largest number of recorded interactions were Carollia perspicillata (357), Artibeus jamaicensis (263), and Artibeus lituratus (228). The fly species with the largest number of recorded interactions were Trichobius joblingi (256), Megistopoda aranea (235), and Megistopoda proxima (215). The interaction data were extracted, filtered, taxonomically harmonized, and made available in a tidy format together with linked data on bat population, fly population, study reference, sampling methods and geographic information from the study sites. This interconnected structure enables the expansion of information for each interaction record, encompassing where and how each interaction occurred, as well as the number of bats and flies involved. We expect BatFly to open new avenues for research focused on different levels of ecological organization and spatial scales. It will help consolidate knowledge about ecological specialization, resource distribution, pathogen transmission, and the drivers of parasite prevalence over a broad spatial range. It may also help to answer key questions such as: Are there differences in fly prevalence or mean infestation across Neotropical ecoregions? What ecological drivers explain those differences? How do specialization patterns vary among fly species in the Neotropics? Furthermore, we expect BatFly to inspire research aimed at understanding how climate and land-use changes may impact host–parasite interactions and disease outbreaks. This kind of research may help us reach Sustainable Development Goal 3, Good Health and Wellbeing, outlined by the United Nations.

They provide key ecosystem services, pollinating tropical plants, dispersing seeds, and controlling insect pest populations, thus driving healthy ecosystems. They account for more than 20% of all living mammalian diversity, and their crown-group evolutionary history dates back to the Eocene. Despite their great numbers and diversity, many species are threatened and endangered. Here we announce Bat1K, an initiative to sequence the genomes of all living bat species (n∼1,300) to chromosome-level assembly. The Bat1K genome consortium unites bat biologists (>148 members as of writing), computational scientists, conservation organizations, genome technologists, and any interested individuals committed to a better understanding of the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie the unique adaptations of bats. Our aim is to catalog the unique genetic diversity present in all living bats to better understand the molecular basis of their unique adaptations; uncover their evolutionary history; link genotype with phenotype; and ultimately better understand, promote, and conserve bats. Here we review the unique adaptations of bats and highlight how chromosome-level genome assemblies can uncover the molecular basis of these traits. We present a novel sequencing and assembly strategy and review the striking societal and scientific benefits that will result from the Bat1K initiative.","2018-02-15","2024-11-14 20:18:08","2025-01-08 21:27:32","","23-46","","","6","","Annu Rev Anim Biosci","Bat Biology, Genomes, and the Bat1K Project","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29166127","","; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\PDPTLKHD\annurev-animal-022516-022811.html; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\4TMRK3DX\Teeling et al. - 2018 - Bat Biology, Genomes, and the Bat1K Project To Generate Chromosome-Level Genomes for All Living Bat.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29166127","","mammals; Chiroptera; Animals; echolocation; ecosystem; flight; longevity; immunity; Adaptation, Physiological; Biological Evolution; Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Research Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we solve this problem by establishing a dynamically maintained database of vertebrate-virus associations, called The Global Virome in One Network (VIRION). The VIRION database has been assembled through both reconciliation of static data sets and integration of dynamically updated databases. These data sources are all harmonized against one taxonomic backbone, including metadata on host and virus taxonomic validity and higher classification; additional metadata on sampling methodology and evidence strength are also available in a harmonized format. In total, the VIRION database is the largest open-source, open-access database of its kind, with roughly half a million unique records that include 9,521 resolved virus “species” (of which 1,661 are ICTV ratified), 3,692 resolved vertebrate host species, and 23,147 unique interactions between taxonomically valid organisms. Together, these data cover roughly a quarter of mammal diversity, a 10th of bird diversity, and ∼6% of the estimated total diversity of vertebrates, and a much larger proportion of their virome than any previous database. We show how these data can be used to test hypotheses about microbiology, ecology, and evolution and make suggestions for best practices that address the unique mix of evidence that coexists in these data. IMPORTANCE Animals and their viruses are connected by a sprawling, tangled network of species interactions. Data on the host-virus network are available from several sources, which use different naming conventions and often report metadata in different levels of detail. VIRION is a new database that combines several of these existing data sources, reconciles taxonomy to a single consistent backbone, and reports metadata in a format designed by and for virologists. Researchers can use VIRION to easily answer questions like “Can any fish viruses infect humans?” or “Which bats host coronaviruses?” or to build more advanced predictive models, making it an unprecedented step toward a full inventory of the global virome.","2022-03","2024-11-22 20:43:46","2024-11-22 20:43:46","2024-11-22 20:43:46","e02985-21","","2","13","","","The Global Virome in One Network (VIRION)","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.asm.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Society for Microbiology","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\ILJE3VAM\Carlson et al. - 2022 - The Global Virome in One Network (VIRION) an Atlas of Vertebrate-Virus Associations.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Open-data global data bases now exist on animal migration, species distribution, conservation status, etc. However, a gap exists for data on population dynamics spanning the rich diversity of the animal kingdom world-wide. This information is fundamental to our understanding of the conditions that have shaped variation in animal life histories and their relationships with the environment, as well as the determinants of invasion and extinction. Matrix population models (MPMs) are among the most widely used demographic tools by animal ecologists. MPMs project population dynamics based on the reproduction, survival and development of individuals in a population over their life cycle. The outputs from MPMs have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among animal species as different as Caenorhabditis elegans, Loxodonta africana and Homo sapiens. Thousands of animal demographic records exist in the form of MPMs, but they are dispersed throughout the literature, rendering comparative analyses difficult. Here, we introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, an open-data online repository, which in its version 1.0.0 contains data on 345 species world-wide, from 402 studies with a total of 1625 population projection matrices. COMADRE also contains ancillary information (e.g. ecoregion, taxonomy, biogeography, etc.) that facilitates interpretation of the numerous demographic metrics that can be derived from its MPMs. We provide R code to some of these examples. Synthesis: We introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, a resource for animal demography. Its open-data nature, together with its ancillary information, will facilitate comparative analysis, as will the growing availability of databases focusing on other aspects of the rich animal diversity, and tools to query and combine them. Through future frequent updates of COMADRE, and its integration with other online resources, we encourage animal ecologists to tackle global ecological and evolutionary questions with unprecedented sample size.","2016","2024-11-22 21:10:18","2024-11-22 21:10:18","2024-11-22 21:10:18","371-384","","2","85","","","COMADRE","","","","","","","en","© 2016 The Authors.

It is an undertaking made more difficult by the complex nature of biodiversity and the consequent difficulty in accurately gauging its depletion. In the Living Planet Index, aggregated population trends among vertebrate species indicate the rate of change in the status of biodiversity, and this index can be used to address the question of whether or not the 2010 target has been achieved. We investigated the use of generalized additive models in aggregating large quantities of population trend data, evaluated potential bias that results from collation of existing trends, and explored the feasibility of disaggregating the data (e.g., geographically, taxonomically, regionally, and by thematic area). Our results show strengths in length and completeness of data, little evidence of bias toward threatened species, and the possibility of disaggregation into meaningful subsets. Limitations of the data set are still apparent, in particular the dominance of bird data and gaps in tropical-species population coverage. Population-trend data complement the longer-term, but more coarse-grained, perspectives gained by evaluating species-level extinction rates. To measure progress toward the 2010 target, indicators must be adapted and strategically supplemented with existing data to generate meaningful indicators in time. Beyond 2010, it is critical a strategy be set out for the future development of indicators that will deal with existing data gaps and that is intricately tied to the goals of future biodiversity targets.","2009","2024-11-22 22:16:20","2024-11-22 22:16:20","2024-11-22 22:16:20","317-327","","2","23","","","Monitoring Change in Vertebrate Abundance","","","","","","","en","©2008 Society for Conservation Biology","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01117.x","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\PENMZLYH\Collen et al. - 2009 - Monitoring Change in Vertebrate Abundance the Living Planet Index.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\XN9R98HG\j.1523-1739.2008.01117.html","","","Living Planet Index; population time series; 2010 target; biodiversity decline; Convención de la Diversidad Biológica; Convention on Biological Diversity; declinación de la biodiversidad; indicadores de amenaza; Índice del Planeta Viviente; objetivo 2010; series de tiempo poblacionales; species abundance; threat indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This database includes shapefiles with taxonomic information and the extent of occurrence for each species, and has been used in hundreds of studies in ecology, biogeography and conservation. Here we provide updated distribution maps that comprise the extent of occurrence of the neotropical bat species in the superfamily Noctilionoidea (Mammalia: Chiroptera) after a thorough research of new records published between January 2008 and March 2018. The main motivation for this update was the inclusion of spatial and climatic variables in explaining the ecological and taxonomic diversity of noctilionoid bats. The core of the superfamily (246 species distributed in five families out of 250 species) occurs in the Neotropics and shows ecological diversity unparalleled among mammals. This clade also shows the only evolutionary shift towards higher speciation rates within the order Chiroptera. Updating the range maps for these bats resulted in the modification of maps of 94 species, and the creation of new maps for 37 species missing from the IUCN database. From the 94 modified maps, 55 species increased their latitudinal range and 38 increased their longitudinal range. These modifications did not change the overall extent of occurrence of the clade.

We were interested in the heritability of body size across taxonomic groups (How conserved is body mass within a genus, family, and order?), in the overall pattern of body mass across continents (Do the moments and other descriptive statistics remain the same across geographic space?), and over evolutionary time (How quickly did body mass patterns iterate on the patterns seen today? Were the Pleistocene extinctions size specific on each continent, and did these events coincide with the arrival of man?). These data are also part of a larger project that seeks to integrate body mass patterns across very diverse taxa (NCEAS Working Group on Body Size in Ecology and Paleoecology: linking pattern and process across space, time, and taxonomic scales). We began with the updated version of D. E. Wilson and D. M. Reeder's taxonomic list of all known Recent mammals of the world (N = 4629 species) to which we added status, distribution, and body mass estimates compiled from the primary and secondary literature. Whenever possible, we used an average of male and female body mass, which was in turn averaged over multiple localities to arrive at our species body mass values. The sources are line referenced in the main data set, with the actual references appearing in a table within the metadata. Mammals have individual records for each continent they occur on. Note that our data set is more than an amalgamation of smaller compilations. Although we relied heavily on a data set for Chiroptera by K. E. Jones (N = 905), the CRC handbook of Mammalian Body Mass (N = 688), and a data set compiled for South America by P. Marquet (N = 505), these represent less than half the records in the current database. The remainder are derived from more than 150 other sources. Furthermore, we include a comprehensive late Pleistocene species assemblage for Africa, North and South America, and Australia (an additional 230 species). “Late Pleistocene” is defined as approximately 11 ka for Africa, North and South America, and as 50 ka for Australia, because these times predate anthropogenic impacts on mammalian fauna. Estimates contained within this data set represent a generalized species value, averaged across sexes and geographic space. Consequently, these data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration of body mass with specific environmental conditions is important. All extant orders of mammals are included, as well as several archaic groups (N = 4859 species). Because some species are found on more than one continent (particularly Chiroptera), there are 5731 entries. We have body masses for the following: Artiodactyla (280 records), Bibymalagasia (2 records), Carnivora (393 records), Cetacea (75 records), Chiroptera (1071 records), Dasyuromorphia (67 records), Dermoptera (3 records), Didelphimorphia (68 records), Diprotodontia (127 records), Hydracoidea (5 records), Insectivora (234 records), Lagomorpha (53 records), Litopterna (2 records), Macroscelidea (14 records), Microbiotheria (1 record), Monotremata (7 records), Notoryctemorphia (1 record), Notoungulata (5 records), Paucituberculata (5 records), Peramelemorphia (24 records), Perissodactyla (47 records), Pholidota (8 records), Primates (276 records), Proboscidea (14 records), Rodentia (1425 records), Scandentia (15 records), Sirenia (6 records), Tubulidentata (1 record), and Xenarthra (75 records).","2003","2024-11-27 20:07:04","2024-11-27 20:07:04","2024-11-27 20:07:04","3403-3403","","12","84","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2003 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/02-9003","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\Q9KNETCK\Smith et al. - 2003 - Body Mass of Late Quaternary Mammals.pdf; C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\UKYCC4AX\02-9003.html","","","body mass; taxonomy; macroecology; extinct mammals; late Quaternary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bats are also important vectors of infectious diseases, harboring more than 100 different virus types. In the present study, we compiled information on bat communities from the Atlantic Forests of South America, a species-rich biome that is highly threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. The ATLANTIC BATS data set comprises 135 quantitative studies carried out in 205 sites, which cover most vegetation types of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest: dense ombrophilous forest, mixed ombrophilous forest, semideciduous forest, deciduous forest, savanna, steppe, and open ombrophilous forest. The data set includes information on more than 90,000 captures of 98 bat species of eight families. Species richness averaged 12.1 per site, with a median value of 10 species (ranging from 1 to 53 species). Six species occurred in more than 50% of the communities: Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Sturnira lilium, Artibeus fimbriatus, Glossophaga soricina, and Platyrrhinus lineatus.

Nevertheless, most data papers have focused on species occurrence or abundance, whereas interactions have received much less attention. To help fill this gap, we have compiled a georeferenced data set of interactions between 93 bat species of the family Phyllostomidae (Chiroptera) and 501 plant species of 68 families. Data came from 169 studies published between 1957 and 2007 covering the entire Neotropical Region, with most records from Brazil (34.5% of all study sites), Costa Rica (16%), and Mexico (14%). Our data set includes 2571 records of frugivory (75.1% of all records) and nectarivory (24.9%). The best represented bat genera are Artibeus (28% of all records), Carollia (24%), Sturnira (10.1%), and Glossophaga (8.8%). Carollia perspicillata (187), Artibeus lituratus (125), Artibeus jamaicensis (94), Glossophaga soricina (86), and Artibeus planirostris (74) were the bat species with the broadest diets recorded based on the number of plant species. Among the plants, the best represented families were Moraceae (17%), Piperaceae (15.4%), Urticaceae (9.2%), and Solanaceae (9%). Plants of the genera Cecropia (46), Ficus (42), Piper (40), Solanum (31), and Vismia (27) exhibited the largest number of interactions. These data are stored as arrays (records, sites, and studies) organized by logical keys and rich metadata, which helped to compile the information on different ecological and geographic scales, according to how they should be used. Our data set on bat-plant interactions is by far the most extensive, both in geographic and taxonomic terms, and includes abiotic information of study sites, as well as ecological information of plants and bats. It has already facilitated several studies and we hope it will stimulate novel analyses and syntheses, in addition to pointing out important gaps in knowledge.

This overall pattern is primarily associated with habitat loss or degradation, and human persecution for terrestrial mammals, and pollution, open net fishing, climate change, and prey depletion for marine mammals. Mammals play a key role in maintaining ecosystems functionality and resilience, and therefore information on their distribution is crucial to delineate and support conservation actions. MAMMALS IN PORTUGAL is a publicly available data set compiling unpublished georeferenced occurrence records of 92 terrestrial, volant, and marine mammals in mainland Portugal and archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira that includes 105,026 data entries between 1873 and 2021 (72% of the data occurring in 2000 and 2021). The methods used to collect the data were: live observations/captures (43%), sign surveys (35%), camera trapping (16%), bioacoustics surveys (4%) and radiotracking, and inquiries that represent less than 1% of the records. The data set includes 13 types of records: (1) burrows | soil mounds | tunnel, (2) capture, (3) colony, (4) dead animal | hair | skulls | jaws, (5) genetic confirmation, (6) inquiries, (7) observation of live animal (8), observation in shelters, (9) photo trapping | video, (10) predators diet | pellets | pine cones/nuts, (11) scat | track | ditch, (12) telemetry and (13) vocalization | echolocation. The spatial uncertainty of most records ranges between 0 and 100 m (76%). Rodentia (n =31,573) has the highest number of records followed by Chiroptera (n = 18,857), Carnivora (n = 18,594), Lagomorpha (n = 17,496), Cetartiodactyla (n = 11,568) and Eulipotyphla (n = 7008). The data set includes records of species classified by the IUCN as threatened (e.g., Oryctolagus cuniculus [n = 12,159], Monachus monachus [n = 1,512], and Lynx pardinus [n = 197]). We believe that this data set may stimulate the publication of other European countries data sets that would certainly contribute to ecology and conservation-related research, and therefore assisting on the development of more accurate and tailored conservation management strategies for each species.

In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, several species of birds (especially hummingbirds), bats, and non-flying mammals, as well as one lizard feed on nectar, often act as pollinators and contribute to seed output of flowering plants. We present a dataset containing information on flowering plants visited by nectar-feeding vertebrates and sampled at 166 localities in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. This dataset provides information on 1902 unique interactions among 515 species of flowering plants and 129 species of potential vertebrate pollinators and the patterns of species diversity across latitudes. All plant-vertebrate interactions compiled were recorded through direct observations of visits, and no inferences of pollinators based on floral syndromes were included. We also provide information on the most common plant traits used to understand the interactions between flowers and nectar-feeding vertebrates: plant growth form, corolla length, rate of nectar production per hour in bagged flowers, nectar concentration, flower color and shape, time of anthesis, presence or absence of perceptible fragrance by human, and flowering phenology as well as the plant's threat status by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classification. For the vertebrates, status of threat by IUCN classification, body mass, bill or rostrum size are provided. Information on the frequency of visits and pollen deposition on the vertebrate's body is provided from the original source when available. The highest number of unique interactions is recorded for birds (1771) followed by bats (110). For plants, Bromeliaceae contains the highest number of unique interactions (606), followed by Fabaceae (242) and Gesneriaceae (104). It is evident that there was geographical bias of the studies throughout the southeast of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and that most effort was directed to flower-hummingbird interactions. However, it reflects a worldwide tendency of more plants interacting with birds compared with other vertebrate species. The lack of similar protocols among studies to collect basic data limits the comparisons among areas and generalizations. Nevertheless, this dataset represents a notable effort to organize and highlight the importance of vertebrate pollinators in this hotspot of biodiversity on Earth and represents the data currently available.

The majority of emerging infectious disease outbreaks are caused by zoonotic/vector-borne viruses. Bats and rodents are the two most important reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses that can cross species barriers to infect humans, whereas mosquitos and ticks are well-established major vectors of many arboviral diseases. Moreover, some emerging zoonotic diseases require a vector to spread or are intrinsically vector-borne and zoonotically transmitted. In this study, we present a newly upgraded database of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses designated ZOVER (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/ZOVER). It incorporates two previously released databases, DBatVir and DRodVir, for bat- and rodent-associated viruses, respectively, and further collects up-to-date knowledge on mosquito- and tick-associated viruses to establish a comprehensive online resource for zoonotic and vector-borne viruses. Additionally, it integrates a set of online visualization tools for convenient comparative analyses to facilitate the discovery of potential patterns of virome diversity and ecological characteristics between/within different viral hosts/vectors.

Assembling multispecies trait data from diverse literature sources into a single comprehensive data set requires detailed consideration of methods to reliably compile data for particular species, and to derive single estimates from multiple sources based on different techniques and definitions. Here we describe PanTHERIA, a species-level data set compiled for analysis of life history, ecology, and geography of all known extant and recently extinct mammals. PanTHERIA is derived from a database capable of holding multiple geo-referenced values for variables within a species containing 100 740 lines of biological data for extant and recently extinct mammalian species, collected over a period of three years by 20 individuals. PanTHERIA also includes spatial databases of mammalian geographic ranges and global climatic and anthropogenic variables. Here we detail how the data fields are extracted and defined for PanTHERIA using a customized data input format (MammalForm); how data were collected from the literature, species names and sources tracked, error-checking and validation procedures applied, and how data were consolidated into species-level values for each variable. Tables of the consolidated species-level values are made available for each of two recent species-level taxonomic classifications of mammals, as well as associated taxonomic synonymy conversion and data-input files. This study provides a useful guide to prospective researchers on how to structure and codify life-history, ecological, geographic, and taxonomic data and methods to extract meaningful species-level traits. It also provides comprehensive information on traits like size, diet, environmental conditions, and ecology to permit macroecological and macroevolutionary analyses of this important clade.

In macroecological studies, values are typically aggregated to species means to examine general patterns of use of space by animals. However, this ignores the environmental context in which the home range was estimated and does not account for intraspecific variation in home range size. In addition, the focus of macroecological studies on home ranges has historically been biased towards terrestrial mammals. The use of aggregated numbers and the terrestrial focus limit our ability to examine home-range patterns across different environments, their variation in time and variation between different levels of organization. Here, we introduce HomeRange, a global database with 75,611 home-range values across 960 different species of mammals, including terrestrial, aquatic and aerial species. Main types of variables contained The dataset contains estimates of home ranges of mammals, species names, methodological information on data collection, method of home-range estimation, period of data collection, study coordinates and name of location, in addition to species traits derived from the studies, such as body mass, life stage, reproductive status and locomotor habit. Spatial location and grain The collected data are distributed globally. Across studies, the spatial accuracy varies, with the coarsest resolution being 1°. Time period and grain The data represent information published between 1939 and 2022. Across studies, the temporal accuracy varies; some studies report start and end dates specific to the day, whereas for other studies only the month or year is reported. Major taxa and level of measurement Mammalian species from 24 of the 27 different taxonomic orders. Home-range estimates range from individual-level values to population-level averages.

Accordingly, a wealth of trait data is available for many organism groups, but this data is underexploited due to a lack of standardization and heterogeneity in data formats and definitions. We review current initiatives and structures developed for standardizing trait data and discuss the importance of standardization for trait data hosted in distributed open-access repositories. In order to facilitate the standardization and harmonization of distributed trait datasets by data providers and data users, we propose a standardized vocabulary that can be used for storing and sharing ecological trait data. We discuss potential incentives and challenges for the wide adoption of such a standard by data providers. The use of a standard vocabulary allows for trait datasets from heterogeneous sources to be aggregated more easily into compilations and facilitates the creation of interfaces between software tools for trait-data handling and analysis. By aiding decentralized trait-data standardization, our vocabulary may ease data integration and use of trait data for a broader ecological research community and enable global syntheses across a wide range of taxa and ecosystems.","2019","2024-09-06 16:08:24","2025-01-14 20:57:35","2025-01-14 20:46:00","2006-2019","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

As such, there is an urgent need for new tools and strategies to help identify, monitor and conserve biodiversity hotspots. This is especially true for frugivores, species consuming fruit, because of their important role in seed dispersal and maintenance of forest structure and health. One way to identify these areas is by quantifying functional diversity, which measures the unique roles of species within a community and is valuable for conservation because of its relationship with ecosystem functioning. Unfortunately, the functional trait information required for these studies can be sparse for certain taxa and specific traits and difficult to harmonize across disparate data sources, especially in biodiversity hotspots. To help fill this need, we compiled Frugivoria, a trait database containing ecological, life-history, morphological and geographical traits for mammals and birds exhibiting frugivory. Frugivoria encompasses species in contiguous moist montane forests and adjacent moist lowland forests of Central and South America—the latter specifically focusing on the Andean states. Compared with existing trait databases, Frugivoria harmonizes existing trait databases, adds new traits, extends traits originally only available for mammals to birds also and fills gaps in trait categories from other databases. Furthermore, we create a cross-taxa subset of shared traits to aid in analysis of mammals and birds. In total, Frugivoria adds 8662 new trait values for mammals and 14,999 for birds and includes a total of 45,216 trait entries with only 11.37% being imputed. Frugivoria also contains an open workflow that harmonizes trait and taxonomic data from disparate sources and enables users to analyse traits in space. As such, this open-access database, which aligns with FAIR data principles, fills a major knowledge gap, enabling more comprehensive trait-based studies of species in this ecologically important region. Main Types of Variable Contained Ecological, life-history, morphological and geographical traits.

We combined and harmonised taxonomic, spatial, phylogenetic, and attribute data with phylogeny-based multiple imputation to provide a comprehensive data resource (TetrapodTraits 1.0.0) that includes values, predictions, and sources for body size, activity time, micro- and macrohabitat, ecosystem, threat status, biogeography, insularity, environmental preferences, and human influence, for all 33,281 tetrapod species covered in recent fully sampled phylogenies. We assess gaps and biases across taxa and space, finding that shared data missing in attribute values increased with taxon-level completeness and richness across clades. Prediction of missing attribute values using multiple imputation revealed substantial changes in estimated macroecological patterns. These results highlight biases incurred by nonrandom missingness and strategies to best address them. While there is an obvious need for further data collection and updates, our phylogeny-informed database of tetrapod traits can support a more comprehensive representation of tetrapod species and their attributes in ecology, evolution, and conservation research.","2024-07-11","2025-01-21 18:03:29","2025-01-21 18:03:52","2025-01-21 18:03:29","e3002658","","7","22","","PLOS Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\rober\Zotero\storage\WLJR9GNC\Moura et al. - 2024 - A phylogeny-informed characterisation of global tetrapod traits addresses data gaps and biases.pdf","","To Read","Amphibians; Animal phylogenetics; Biodiversity; Biogeography; Birds; Phylogenetic analysis; Phylogenetics; Taxonomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
