-   HTML table with trait types, functional dimensions, times a trait is represented in the studies, type of variable, description and citations for the:
    -   *table_trait_sources_full.html:* Full list of traits obtained
    -   *table_trait_sources_2plus.html:* Traits reported in 2 or more studies
    -   *table_trait_sources_eq1.html*: Traits reported in only one study besides the proposal made by Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres (2021)
    -   *table_trait_sources_cf2021.html:* Traits reported only in the proposal made by Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres (2021).
-   Histogram of the total of times a functional trait is reported in the studies consulted by trait type and complex or functional dimension for the:
    -   *type_dimensions_hist_full.png*: Full list of traits obtained
    -   *type_dimensions_hist_2plus.png:* Traits reported in 2 or more studies
    -   *type_dimensions_hist_1db.png*: Traits reported in only one study besides the proposal made by Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres (2021)
    -   *type_dimensions_hist_cf2021.png*: Traits reported only in the proposal made by Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres (2021).

The reasoning for isolating traits reported in one study is twofold: a) A trait reported only in the proposal made by Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres (2021) doesn’t contain any data, and b) a trait found only once is prone to skew the representativeness of the trait to a single study. Nevertheless, traits represented once, besides of Castillo-Figueroa & Pérez-Torres (2021) proposal, should be individually checked as they might be too bat-specific to be well represented in multi-taxa assessments.
