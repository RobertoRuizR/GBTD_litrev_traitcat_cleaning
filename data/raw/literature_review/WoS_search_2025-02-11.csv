In this study, we investigated the functional diversity and trait-environment relationships of phyllostomid bats in an Amazonian forest-savannah mosaic. Bats were captured across ten forest fragments, 11 savannahs, and five continuous forest sampling sites. We assessed the effect of habitat type using taxonomic and functional alpha-diversity and functional uniqueness at the community-level. We evaluated the relationships between functional traits, environmental characteristics, and species distribution using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Furthermore, we estimated the contribution of richness change and replacement components among habitats using functional beta-diversity. Forested habitats (forest fragments and continuous forest) retained more diverse functional assemblages compared to savannahs, with a greater abundance of species with unique traits, such as the gleaning insectivorous bats (e.g., Gardnerycteris crenulatum, Lophostoma silvicola, Tonatia maresi). Functional beta-diversity between forest fragments and savannah was driven significantly by the replacement of traits, indicating the substitution of species that perform different ecological functions in these habitats. Our study highlights the importance of the forest-savannah mosaic for maintaining bat assemblage functional diversity and their associated ecosystem services.","[Kinap, Natalia Margarido; Rabelo, Rafael M.; Bobrowiec, Paulo Estefano D.] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonia INPA, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Manaus, AM, Brazil; [Farneda, Fabio Z.] Univ Estadual Londrina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, Londrina, PR, Brazil; [Rabelo, Rafael M.] Inst Desenvolvimento Sustentavel Mamiraua, Grp Pesquisa Ecol Vertebrados Terr, Tefe, AM, Brazil; [Bernard, Enrico] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Lab Ciencia Aplicada Conservacao Biodiversidade, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Bobrowiec, Paulo Estefano D.] Inst Tecnol Vale, Belem, PA, Brazil",Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Universidade Estadual de Londrina; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Instituto Tecnologico Vale Desenvolvimento Sustentavel,"Kinap, NM (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonia INPA, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Manaus, AM, Brazil.",nataliakinap@gmail.com,"Rabelo, Rafael/N-9190-2019; Bernard, Enrico/J-6397-2012; Bobrowiec, Paulo/A-2630-2013",,Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM); Bolsista CAPES/BRASIL [88887.923859/2023-00]; Programa Nacional de Pos-Doutorado/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [88887.370067/2019-00],Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM)); Bolsista CAPES/BRASIL; Programa Nacional de Pos-Doutorado/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"NMK was supported by a Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM) scholarship.

Mega dams in lowland tropical forests often create large archipelagos, leading to biodiversity decay and disruption of ecosystem functioning in remnant habitat islands. 2. We investigated the functional diversity and functional trait filtering of aerial insectivorous bats in both insular forest patches created by a vast similar to 30-year-old hydropower reservoir and the adjacent mainland continuous forest in Central Amazonia. 3. Bats were surveyed using passive bat recorders across 34 forest sites. Based on a set of morphological traits derived for each species recorded, we estimated both the bat functional richness, functional evenness and functional dispersion at each surveyed site. We further assessed the effects of local vegetation, patch and landscape features on patterns of functional diversity. The interaction between functional traits, environmental characteristics, and species distribution was investigated using a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. 4. We found that mainland sites retained higher functional richness and lower functional evenness compared to forest islands, indicating a more complete functional assemblage in the mainland. Additionally, species composition was affected by local vegetation structure and forest area, with small isolated islands exhibiting pervasive loss of functional traits. RLQ and fourth-corner analyses showed that larger understorey foraging species with greater dispersal capacity, constant frequency-frequency modulated calls, and higher frequency of maximum energy were associated with more isolated small islands. Conversely, forest subcanopy species, exhibiting quasi-constant frequency calls and presenting low dispersal capacity were associated with continuous forests and islands with greater forest area, and were therefore more sensitive to habitat insularization. 5. Our study calls attention to the pervasive impacts induced by large dams on the functional diversity of tropical insectivorous bats. We recommend that future assessments of the effects of habitat fragmentation on mammals should include traits linked to ecosystem services. In designing and licensing new dams, we suggest the creation of extensive protected areas surrounding mainland forests to minimize the detrimental impacts of small isolated islands and safeguard the full complement of key ecological functions provided by insectivorous bats.","[Colombo, Guthieri Teixeira; Di Ponzio, Raffaello; Bobrowiec, Paulo Estefano D.] Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Benchimol, Maira] Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Lab Ecol Aplicada & Conservacao, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidad, Ilheus, BA, Brazil; [Peres, Carlos A.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Peres, Carlos A.] Inst Jurua, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil",Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz; University of East Anglia,"Colombo, GT; Bobrowiec, PED (corresponding author), Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",guthiericolombo@gmail.com; paulobobro@gmail.com,"Bobrowiec, Paulo/A-2630-2013; Peres, Carlos/ABE-8361-2020; Peres, Carlos/B-1276-2013; Benchimol, Maira/I-7664-2014","Peres, Carlos/0000-0002-1588-8765; Di Ponzio, Raffaello/0000-0002-7527-3594; Benchimol, Maira/0000-0002-1238-1619",Amazonas Distribuidora de Energia S/A; Associacao Comunidade Waimiri Atroari; Idea Wild; ARPA; National Geographic Society; REBIO Uatuma/ICMBio; Conservation Food and Health Foundation; Rufford Small Grant Foundation; WCS Research Fellowship Program,Amazonas Distribuidora de Energia S/A; Associacao Comunidade Waimiri Atroari; Idea Wild; ARPA; National Geographic Society(National Geographic Society); REBIO Uatuma/ICMBio; Conservation Food and Health Foundation; Rufford Small Grant Foundation; WCS Research Fellowship Program,Amazonas Distribuidora de Energia S/A; ARPA; Associacao Comunidade Waimiri Atroari; Idea Wild; National Geographic Society; REBIO Uatuma/ICMBio; The Conservation Food and Health Foundation; The Rufford Small Grant Foundation; WCS Research Fellowship Program,,69,15,15,10,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Despite being sensitive to water loss, bats successfully inhabit a wide range of arid lands. We here investigated how functional traits of bat assemblages vary along the global aridity gradient to identify traits that favour their persistence in arid environments. Location Global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Bats. Methods We mapped the assemblage-level averages of four key bat traits describing wing morphology, echolocation and body size, based on a grid of 100-km resolution and a pool of 915 bat species, and modelled them against aridity values. To support our results, we conducted analyses also at the species level to control for phylogenetic autocorrelation. Results At the assemblage level, we detected a rise in values of aspect ratio, wing loading and forearm length, and a decrease in echolocation frequency with increasing aridity. These patterns were consistent with trends detected at the species level for all traits. Main conclusions Our findings show that trait variation in bats is associated with the aridity gradient and suggest that greater mobility and larger body size are advantageous features in arid environments. Greater mobility favours bats' ability to track patchy and temporary resources, while the reduced surface-to-volume ratio associated with a larger body size is likely to reduce water stress by limiting cutaneous evaporation. These findings highlight the importance of extending attention from species-specific adaptations to broad scale and multispecies variation in traits when investigating the ability of species to withstand arid conditions.","[Conenna, Irene; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Global Change & Conservat Lab, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Conenna, Irene; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Santini, Luca] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Rome, Italy; [Santini, Luca] CNR, Inst Res Terr Ecosyst CNR IRET, Rome, Italy; [Rocha, Ricardo] Univ Porto, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, CIBIO InBIO, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Rocha, Ricardo] Univ Lisbon, Inst Agron, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, CIBIO InBIO, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Monadjem, Ara] Univ Eswatini, Dept Biol Sci, Kwaluseni, Eswatini; [Monadjem, Ara] Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, Mammal Res Inst, Pretoria, South Africa; [Russo, Danilo] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Wildlife Res Unit, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Sapienza University Rome; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sugli Ecosistemi Terrestri (IRET); Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Pretoria; University of Naples Federico II,"Conenna, I (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Global Change & Conservat Lab, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",Irene.conenna@gmail.com,"Cabeza, Mar/ABC-4297-2020; Rocha, Ricardo/AAM-3749-2021; Monadjem, Ara/K-7279-2014; Santini, Luca/M-8492-2018","Cabeza, Mar/0000-0002-7410-7631; Santini, Luca/0000-0002-5418-3688; Rocha, Ricardo/0000-0003-2757-7347","Ella ja Georg Ehrnroothin Saatio [8-6349-18, 9--7968-5]; ARDITI -Madeira's Regional Agency for the Development of Research, Technology and Innovation [M1420-09-5369-FSE-000002]; Nordenskiold-samfundet","Ella ja Georg Ehrnroothin Saatio; ARDITI -Madeira's Regional Agency for the Development of Research, Technology and Innovation; Nordenskiold-samfundet","Ella ja Georg Ehrnroothin Saatio, Grant/Award Number: #8-6349-18 and #9--7968-5; ARDITI -Madeira's Regional Agency for the Development of Research, Technology and Innovation, Grant/Award Number: M1420-09-5369-FSE-000002; Nordenskiold-samfundet",,81,19,20,3,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

However, the relative importance of traits and relative abundances for the role species play in seed dispersion networks remains poorly explored. Here, we analyzed 20 Neotropical seed dispersal networks distributed from Mexico to southeastern Brazil to evaluate how relative abundance and functional traits influence bat species' roles in seed dispersal networks. We tested how bat relative abundance and traits relate to species contribution to between-module (c metric) and within-module connectivity (z metric) and their position and potential to mediate indirect effects between species (betweenness centrality). Our results indicate that relative abundance is the main determinant of the role bats play in the networks, while traits such as aspect ratio show modest yet statistically significant importance in predicting specific roles. Moreover, all seed dispersal networks presented two or three superabundant obligatory frugivore species that interacted with a high number of plants. The modest influence of the functional traits on species' roles is likely related to the low variation of morphological traits related to foraging ecology, which reduces the chances of morphological mismatching between consumers and resources in the system. In this scenario, abundant bats have higher chances of encountering resources and being capable of consuming them which leads such species to play critical roles in the community by acting as module hubs and network connectors.","[Laurindo, Rafael de Souza; Silva Mancini, Matheus Camargo; Mello, Rodrigo de Macedo; Gregorin, Renato] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, CP 3037, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Vizentin-Bugoni, Jeferson] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Turner Hall,1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL USA; [Tavares, Davi Castro] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, Syst Ecol Grp, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",Universidade Federal de Lavras; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Leibniz Association; Leibniz Zentrum fur Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT),"Laurindo, RD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, CP 3037, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",rafaelslaurindo@gmail.com,"Gregorin, Renato/D-8072-2016; Vizentin-Bugoni, Jeferson/J-9342-2016; Laurindo, Rafael/E-7042-2013; Mancini, Matheus/C-9221-2019; Tavares, Davi/H-7960-2015; Laurindo, Rafael/S-2922-2017","Tavares, Davi/0000-0002-6811-9572; Laurindo, Rafael/0000-0002-9326-3509; Mancini, Matheus/0000-0002-5041-1639",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) [001]; US Army CERL-ERDC; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation/CAPES [88881.162169/2017-01],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); US Army CERL-ERDC(United States Department of DefenseUnited States Army); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation/CAPES,"We thank the Brazilian Army, Pindamonhangaba City Hall, and Debora Mascarenhas (from Renopolis Farm), Sao Jose dos Campos City Hall for logistic support and permission to work in lands under their responsibility.

This study uses phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate which functional traits of bat species are correlated with their vulnerability to fragmentation in a tropical landscape with low fragment-matrix contrast. Bats were captured over twoyears in eight forest fragments, nine control sites in continuous forest, and in the secondary forest matrix at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazon, Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that there is a significant relationship between species functional traits, environmental gradients (continuous forest and fragment interiors, edges and matrix) and patterns of species distribution using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models, as well as a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Mobility, body mass, wing morphology, and trophic level were the most important traits linked to fragmentation sensitivity based on the PGLS analysis, while body mass and trophic level emerged as the best predictors in the fourth-corner analysis. These last two traits were correlated with the loss of continuous forest characteristics, such as high-stature trees and forest cover. Many animalivorous bat species rarely persist in small fragments (<100ha) and in the secondary forest matrix, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit the smaller and phytophagous species.Synthesis and applications. Functional traits of species and environmental variables jointly predict local variation in patterns of bat occupancy and abundance in fragmented tropical landscapes. To minimize local extinctions, we recommend increasing habitat availability and enhancing structural and functional connectivity at the landscape scale through the creation, restoration and maintenance of corridors and stepping stones. These measures should be coupled with improving matrix quality by promoting secondary forest regeneration and persistence to effectively reduce fragment-matrix contrast.

We predict that individual bats will show functional dietary differences consistent with energetic requirements and hunting skills. We used DNA metabarcoding to determine the diet of 126 Mediterranean horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus euryale) from two different sites during three seasons. Simultaneously, we measured moth availability and characterized the traits of 290 moth taxa. Next, we explored the relationship between phylogeny and traits of all consumed and available moth taxa. Finally, we assessed the relationship between individual traits of bats and traits related to prey profitability, for which we used the RLQ and fourth-corner statistical techniques. Seasonality was the main factor explaining the functional dietary variation in adult bats, with moths consumed irrespective of their phylogenetic relationships. While adults consumed moths with a broad range in wing loading, body mass and echolocation detection ability, juveniles consumed slower, smaller and lighter moths, which suggests that young individuals may undergo some fitness gain and/or psychomotor learning process during which they would acquire more effective foraging skills. Our approach revealed a degree of functional flexibility in the trophic niche previously unknown for an insectivorous bat. Rhinolophus euryale consumed a wide variety of moth taxa differing in profitability throughout seasons and between ontogenetic stages. We showed the validity of trait-based approaches to gain new insights in the trophic specialization of predators consuming hundreds of species of prey.","[Arrizabalaga-Escudero, Aitor; Garin, Inazio; Goiti, Urtzi; Aihartza, Joxerra] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Zool & Anim Cell Biol, Leioa, The Basque Coun, Spain; [Merckx, Thomas] UCLouvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, Behav Ecol & Conservat Grp, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Merckx, Thomas] Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol & Genet, Oulu, Finland; [Garcia-Baquero, Gonzalo] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, Leioa, The Basque Coun, Spain; [Wahlberg, Niklas] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden; [Aizpurua, Ostaizka] Univ Copenhagen, Sect Evolutionary Genom, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Basque Country; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Oulu; University of Basque Country; Lund University; University of Copenhagen,"Aihartza, J (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Zool & Anim Cell Biol, Leioa, The Basque Coun, Spain.",joxerra.aihartza@ehu.eus,"Garin, Inazio/B-8115-2009; Aihartza, Joxerra/Z-3061-2019; Goiti, Urtzi/AAA-4534-2019; Merckx, Thomas/HHN-5979-2022; Aizpurua, Ostaizka/V-9490-2019; Wahlberg, Niklas/B-7765-2008","Aizpurua, Ostaizka/0000-0001-8053-3672; Goiti, Urtzi/0000-0001-5787-054X; Merckx, Thomas/0000-0002-6195-3302","Spanish Government [CGL2012-38610]; Government of the Basque Country [BFI-2011-245, IT754-13]",Spanish Government(Spanish Government); Government of the Basque Country,"Spanish Government, Grant/Award Number: CGL2012-38610; Government of the Basque Country, Grant/Award Number: BFI-2011-245 and IT754-13",,70,25,27,3,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Bats' role in those ecosystems is critical because of multiple bat-mediated processes. Such processes are strongly related to bats' functional traits. However, it is poorly known which bat's functional traits could relate to variations in environmental conditions in tropical dry forests. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that bat functional traits would be significantly associated with landscape variables, climatic variables, and land-use intensity. For testing these hypotheses, we used data from phyllostomid and mormoopid bats captured in mist nets and data from non-phyllostomid insectivorous bat species registered by passive acoustic monitoring. We considered six functional traits for phyllostomid and mormoopid bats, and for non-phyllostomid insectivorous bats, we added two echolocation parameters. We measured five environmental variables, two of local climate (daily maximum temperature and wind speed) and three of landscape features (total area of water and closeness, probability of finding caves, and conservation status). The relationships between bat functional traits and environmental variables were evaluated using the RLQ and the fourth-corner analysis. We captured 360 individuals belonging to 14 species with mist nets (Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae), and we identified 18 species and six sonotypes with acoustic sampling (Emballonuridae, Mormoopidae, Molossidae, Natalidae, Noctilionidae, and Vespertilionidae). We found that bats' functional traits related to environmental conditions were pulse structure, diet, vertical foraging stratification, and trophic level, although these relationships varied among bats' ecological roles. The hematophagous were related to water bodies' closeness, and animalivorous bats, mostly mormoopids, showed a relationship with the probability of finding caves. Insectivorous bats that mostly forage on the canopy and emit qCF calls were significantly related to more conserved sites, and bats that emit qCF pulses were significantly associated with less area covered by water. Our findings provide insights into how bat functional traits vary in their relationships with environmental conditions in harsh environments such as dry forests.","[Diaz-B, Camila A.

However, current urban ecology research has focused mostly on urban birds and plants, limiting our ability to make generalizations about the drivers of urban biodiversity globally. To address this gap, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 87 studies, including 180 bat species (Chiroptera) from urban areas in Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. We aimed to (i) understand the importance of functional traits and phylogeny in driving changes in urban bat assemblages, and (ii) assess the capacity of traits for predicting which types of species are most sensitive to urbanization. Our results indicate that species-specific functional traits explain differences in the intensity of urban habitat use. Urban tolerance mainly occurred within the open and edge space foraging and trawling species as well as in bats with flexible roosting strategies. In addition, across bioregions and independent of phylogeny, urban tolerance correlated with higher aspect ratio, a trait enabling fast flight but less agile manoeuvres during aerial food acquisition. Predictive success varied between bioregions, between 43 and 83%. Our analysis demonstrates that the local extinction of bat species in urban areas is non-random, trait-based and predictable, allowing urban landscape managers to tailor local conservation actions to particular types of species.","[Jung, Kirsten] Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Ulm, Germany; [Threlfall, Caragh Grace] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Threlfall, Caragh Grace] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Camperdown, NSW, Australia",Ulm University; University of Melbourne; University of Sydney,"Jung, K (corresponding author), Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Ulm, Germany.",kirsten.jung@uni-ulm.de,"; Threlfall, Caragh/Y-2292-2018","Jung, Kirsten/0000-0002-9449-2215; Threlfall, Caragh/0000-0002-4197-8588",Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program through the Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub; Biodiversity-Exploratory Project - German Research Foundation,Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program through the Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub(Australian Government); Biodiversity-Exploratory Project - German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank everyone who contributed data to this analysis as part of a publication or made original data available to us.

All data were gathered from published literature following the ecological trait-data standard procedure. Missing data for both numerical and categorical traits were imputed with a machine learning approach including species phylogeny. Trophic ecology traits showed the highest coverage in the literature (72% of the species averaged over all traits), while reproductive traits the lowest. Our data imputation improved the coverage of AfroBaT especially for reproductive traits, going from 27% to 58% of the species covered.

Effective conservation in heavily-populated palaeotropical hotspots requires a better understanding of which bats can and cannot survive in human-modified landscapes. We used catching and acoustic transects to examine bat assemblages in the Western Ghats of India, and identify the species most sensitive to agricultural change. We quantified functional diversity and trait filtering of assemblages in forest fragments, tea and coffee plantations, and along rivers in tea plantations with and without forested corridors, compared to protected forests. Functional diversity in forest fragments and shade-grown coffee was similar to that in protected forests, but was far lower in tea plantations. Trait filtering was also strongest in tea plantations. Forested river corridors in tea plantations mitigated much of the loss of functional diversity and the trait filtering seen on rivers in tea plantations without forested corridors. The bats most vulnerable to intensive agriculture were frugivorous, large, had short broad wings, or made constant frequency echolocation calls. The last three features are characteristic of forest animal-eating species that typically take large prey, often by gleaning. Ongoing conservation work to restore forest fragments and retain native trees in coffee plantations should be highly beneficial for bats in this landscape. The maintenance of a mosaic landscape with sufficient patches of forest, shade-grown coffee and riparian corridors will help to maintain landscape wide functional diversity in an area dominated by tea plantations.","[Wordley, Claire F.

In this study, we investigated how bat functional diversity has been affected by different anthropogenic impacts in wetlands of the Trans-Andean tropical dry forest of Colombia. Specifically, we analyzed how different functional traits responded to changing environmental conditions and land use and land cover patterns. We sampled six wetlands during the dry periods of the hydrological cycle from 2014 to 2018 and modeled the functional diversity as a function of environmental variables. To understand the association of bat community structure with enviromnental variables and biotic factors, we combined the RLQ analysis and the fourth-corner approach to relate environmental characteristics and species traits. The percentages of water surface area and pasture land were found to be associated with the general traits of bats when analyzed using the relative abundance of species. In addition. changes in functional diversity appeared to be driven mainly by larger species (e.g., Phyllostomus hastatus, Artibeus lituratus), whose presence was primarily associated with heterogeneous areas. The fourth-corner analysis revealed that the greatest length of skull is the trait that best describes the presence of bats in landscapes of pastures, water bodies, and high abundance of the shrubs Vismia sp. and Cecropia sp. These results suggest that combinations of specific features are important drivers of variation in functional diversity between wetlands. Considering the high vulnerability of Colombian wetlands, our findings provide fundamental information for the development of strategies for monitoring wetland biodiversity. The results can help identify priority conservation sites and improve environmental decision making.","[Garcia-Herrera, Leidy, V; Ramirez-Francel, Leidy A.; Losada-Prado, Sergio; Reinoso-Florez, Gladys; Villa-Navarro, Francisco A.; Guevara, Giovany] Univ Tolima, Grp Invest Zool GIZ, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Santa Helena Pane Alta Cl 42 1-02, Ibague 7300062, Tolima, Colombia",Universidad del Tolima,"Garcia-Herrera, LV (corresponding author), Univ Tolima, Grp Invest Zool GIZ, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Santa Helena Pane Alta Cl 42 1-02, Ibague 7300062, Tolima, Colombia.",lvgarcia@ut.edu.co,"Guevara, Giovany/AAD-6290-2019","Ramirez Francel, Leidy Azucena/0000-0002-7144-3365; Guevara, Giovany/0000-0002-2373-1805","CORTOLIMA (Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Tolima) [345-2013, 548-2014, 645-2015, 762-2016, 479-2018]; 2016 para la Formacion de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento del Tolima, Colfuturo (miniciencias) [755]; Departamento del Tolima","CORTOLIMA (Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Tolima); 2016 para la Formacion de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento del Tolima, Colfuturo (miniciencias); Departamento del Tolima","We thank members of Grupo de Investigacion en Zoologia (GIZ) for their assistance with the field work and laboratory analyses, to CORTOLIMA (Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Tolima) by several wetlands related studies from 2013 to 2018 (Contracts signed codes: phase I 345-2013, phase II 548-2014, phase III 645-2015, phase IV 762-2016, and phase V 479-2018).

Knowledge of how species respond to fire-driven habitat changes in these landscapes is limited and generally disconnected from our understanding of adaptations that underpin responses to fire. We aimed to investigate drivers of occupancy of a diverse bat community in a fire-altered landscape, while identifying functional traits that underpinned these relationships. We recorded bats acoustically at 83 sites (n = 249 recording nights) across the Plumas National Forest in the northern Sierra Nevada over 3 summers (2015-2017). We investigated relationships between fire regime, physiographic variables, forest structure and probability of bat occupancy for nine frequently detected species. We used fourth-corner regression and RLQ analysis to identify ecomorphological traits driving species-environment relationships across 17 bat species. Traits included body mass; call frequency, bandwidth, and duration; and foraging strategy based on vegetation structure (open, edge, or clutter). Relationships between bat traits and fire regime were underpinned by adaptations to diverse forest structure. Bats with traits adapting them to foraging in open habitats, including emitting longer duration and narrow bandwidth calls, were associated with higher severity and more frequent fires, whereas bats with traits consistent with clutter tolerance were negatively associated with fire frequency and burn severity. Relationships between edge-adapted bat species and fire were variable and may be influenced by prey preference or habitat configuration at a landscape scale. Predicted increases in fire frequency and severity in western US coniferous forests are likely to shift dominance in the bat community to open-adapted species and those able to exploit postfire resource pulses (aquatic insects, beetles, and snags). Managing for pyrodiversity within the western United States is likely important for maintaining bat community diversity, as well as diversity of other biotic communities.","[Blakey, Rachel V.; Corcoran, Derek] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Missouri Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Columbia, MO USA; [Blakey, Rachel V.; Kesler, Dylan C.; Siegel, Rodney B.] Inst Bird Populat, Point Reyes Stn, CA USA; [Webb, Elisabeth B.] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, US Geol Survey, Missouri Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Columbia, MO USA; [Johnson, Matthew] US Forest Serv, Plumas Natl Forest, USDA, Quincy, CA USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Blakey, RV (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",rachelvblakey@gmail.com,"Corcoran, Derek/KDO-2720-2024; Blakey, Rachel/AAD-9772-2019","Webb, Lisa/0000-0003-3851-6056; Blakey, Rachel/0000-0002-6654-5703; Corcoran, Derek/0000-0002-0248-6230",U.S. Forest Service,U.S. Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),U.S. Forest Service,,98,34,44,2,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

A focus on the functional traits of species may improve this understanding if species with similar traits (functional guilds) are impacted by landscape change in similar ways, but this idea has not been widely tested on bat communities in urban landscapes. We examined changes in bat species richness and the activity level of species in different functional guilds within 72 residential neighbourhoods across 18 towns and cities spanning over 250,000 square km in south-eastern Australia. Species richness increased close to native vegetation, declined with increasing urbanization, and had a hump-shaped relationship with neighbourhood vegetation cover. Also, the activity level of all bat species combined peaked at mid-range values of neighbourhood vegetation cover. The activity of species in the open-adapted guild was not strongly related to any urban characteristic, but our results concur with previous findings that the activity of most open-adapted species does not appear to be negatively impacted by urbanization. Conversely, clutter-adapted species appear more sensitive to urbanization and their activity level was negatively related to urban intensity and increased closer to native vegetation, consistent with previous studies. The functional-trait approach may improve the capacity to make generalisations across different landscape contexts for clutter-adapted and open-adapted guilds, but is currently hampered for other bat species owing to variation in the behaviour of different species assigned to the same functional guild, and a lack of ecological knowledge regarding the impacts of different types of landscape change on particular species.","[Luck, Gary W.; Smallbone, Lisa] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Threlfall, Caragh] Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Melbourne, Vic 3121, Australia; [Law, Bradley] Forest Sci Ctr, Dept Primary Ind, Beecroft, NSW 2119, Australia",Charles Sturt University; University of Melbourne; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW,"Luck, GW (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",galuck@csu.edu.au,"Law, Brad/IAQ-8054-2023; Threlfall, Caragh/Y-2292-2018","Threlfall, Caragh/0000-0002-4197-8588; Luck, Gary/0000-0002-7266-5568; Law, Bradley/0000-0002-3991-3865",Australian Research Council [DP0770261]; Australian Research Council [DP0770261] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This project was funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery Grant (DP0770261) to GWL.

Empirical evidence regarding this question remains limited for many tropical regions despite their importance for conservation. Here, we used body mass, wing morphology, trophic level, and diet to identify which traits make phyllostomid bat species more vulnerable to human impacts in the Colombian Orinoco Llanos. Bats were sampled using mist nets in riparian forests, unflooded forests, flooded savannahs, and conventional rice crops on traditional farmlands with high-intensity agriculture and in private reserves with greater ecosystem protection. We tested the associations between species traits and landscape-structure variables (habitat cover and type, number of habitat patches, shortest distance to water) using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, accounting for both spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelation. Trophic level and diet were the most important traits linked to disturbance sensitivity. Our results indicated that rice crop cover, savannah patches, and altered unflooded forest act as a filter, benefiting disturbance-adapted frugivorous genera in farmlands (e.g., Artibeus spp., Carollia spp., Platyrrhinus spp., Uroderma spp.). Conversely, animalivorous species were strongly associated with savannah cover and riparian forests within reserves (e.g., Lampronycteris brachyotis, Lophostoma brasiliense, Micronycteris minuta, Trachops cirrhosus). Encouraging the creation of more wildlife-friendly landscapes through payments for ecosystem services across the Colombian Llanos will ensure the long-term persistence of disturbance-sensitive species and sustain a complete set of ecological functions and ecosystem services that these bats provide.","[Otalora-Ardila, Aida; Gomez-Posada, Carolina] Inst Invest Recursos Biol Alexander von Humboldt, Villa De Leyva, Colombia; [Otalora-Ardila, Aida; Lopez-Arevalo, Hugo F.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Grp Conservac & Manejo Vida Silvestre, Inst Ciencias Nat, Bogota, Colombia; [Farneda, Fabio Z.; Polania, Jaime] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Medellin, Colombia; [Farneda, Fabio Z.] Univ Estadual Londrina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, Londrina, Brazil; [Meyer, Christoph F.

Understanding how variation in functional traits is associated with species vulnerability in fragmented landscapes is central to the design of effective conservation strategies. Here, we used a whole-ecosystem ecological experiment in the Central Amazon to investigate which functional traits of aerial-hawking insectivorous bats best predict their sensitivity to forest fragmentation. During 2014, bats were surveyed using passive bat recorders in six continuous forest sites, eight forest fragments, eight fragment edges, and eight forest clearings. The interaction between functional traits, environmental characteristics, and species distribution was investigated using a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Our results showed that echolocation call structure, vertical stratification, and wing aspect ratio were the strongest predictors of sensitivity to forest fragmentation. Frequency of maximum energy, body mass, and relative wing loading did not show any correlation with the environmental variables. Bat species with constant-frequency calls were associated with high vegetation density, being more susceptible to forest fragmentation than species with frequency-modulated calls. Vertical stratum preference was also correlated with vegetation structure, indicating that understory species were more sensitive to forest loss than canopy species. Finally, species with high aspect ratio wings were linked to forest edges and clearings. Our findings suggest that species functional traits determine the vulnerability of aerialhawking insectivorous bats toward fragmentation and, similarly, environmental conditions determine if a species is likely to become locally extinct due to fragmentation. Preserving structurally complex forests will be crucial to ensure the long-term persistence of the most sensitive and vulnerable species of this bat ensemble in fragmented landscapes across the Neotropics.","[Fraixedas Nunez, Silvia] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Bellaterra, Spain; [Lopez-Baucells, Adria] Granollers Museum Nat Sci, Granollers, Spain; [Lopez-Baucells, Adria; Rocha, Ricardo; Farneda, Fabio Z.; Palmeirim, Jorge M.; Meyer, Christoph F.

Growing evidence is biased towards the comparison of populations from discrete categories of land uses, ignoring the role of landscape emerging properties on the phenotype selection of wild fauna. Across the largest urban-rural gradient of the Colombian Orinoquia, we measured ecomorphological traits of 216 individuals of the flat-faced fruit-eating bat Artibeus planirostris. We did this to evaluate the scale of effect at which landscape transformation better predicts changes in phenotype and abundance of an urban-tolerant species. Forest percentage at 1.25 km was the main predictor affecting negatively bat abundance and positively its wing aspect ratio and body mass. Landscape variables affected forearm length at all spatial scales, this effect appeared to be sex-dependent, and the most important predictor, forest percentage at 0.5 km, had a negative effect on this trait. Our results indicate that landscape elements and spatial scale interact to shape ecomorphological traits and the abundance of A. planirostris. Interestingly, the scale of effect coincided at 1.25 km among all biological responses, suggesting that species' abundance can be linked to the variation on phenotype under different environmental filters across landscape scenarios.","[Ramirez-Mejia, Andres F.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Fac Estudios Ambientales & Rurales, Bogota, Colombia; [Ramirez-Mejia, Andres F.; Sanchez, Francisco] Univ Llanos, ECOTONOS Res Grp, Villavicencio, Colombia; [Ramirez-Mejia, Andres F.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Ciencias Nat, Inst Ecol Reg IER UNT CONICET, Yerba Buena, Argentina; [Ramirez-Mejia, Andres F.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Inst Miguel Lillo, Yerba Buena, Argentina; [Nicolas Urbina-Cardona, J.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Fac Estudios Ambientales & Rurales, Dept Ecol & Terr, Bogota, Colombia; [Sanchez, Francisco] Univ Llanos, Fac Ciencias Basicas & Ingn, Programa Biol, Villavicencio, Colombia",Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Miguel Lillo Foundation; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Ramírez-Mejía, AF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Fac Estudios Ambientales & Rurales, Bogota, Colombia.;Ramírez-Mejía, AF (corresponding author), Univ Llanos, ECOTONOS Res Grp, Villavicencio, Colombia.",andresfeliper.mejia@gmail.com,"Urbina-Cardona, J.

Its rapid progress is mostly at the expense of natural ecosystems and the species inhabiting them. While some species can adjust quickly and thrive in cities, many others cannot. To support biodiversity conservation and guide management decisions in urban areas, it is important to find robust methods to estimate the urban affinity of species (i.e. their tendency to live in urban areas) and understand how it is associated with their traits. Since previous studies mainly relied on discrete classifications of species' urban affinity, often involving inconsistent assessments or variable parameters, their results were difficult to compare. To address this issue, we developed and evaluated a set of continuous indices that quantify species' urban affinity based on publicly available occurrence data. We investigated the extent to which a species' position along the urban affinity gradient depends on the chosen index and how this choice affects inferences about the relationship between urban affinity and a set of morphological, sensory and functional traits. While these indices are applicable to a wide range of taxonomic groups, we examined their performance using a global set of 356 bat species. As bats vary in sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbances, they provide an interesting case study. We found that different types of indices resulted in different rankings of species on the urban affinity spectrum, but this had little effect on the association of traits with urban affinity. Our results suggest that bat species predisposed to urban life are characterized by low echolocation call frequencies, relatively long call durations, small body size and flexibility in the selection of the roost type. We conclude that simple indices are appropriate and practical, and propose to apply them to more taxa to improve our understanding of how urbanization favours or filters species with particular traits.","[Wolf, Janis M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.; Voigt, Christian C.; Itescu, Yuval] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Berlin, Germany; [Wolf, Janis M.] Univ Greifswald, Inst Zool, Loitzer Str 26, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Jeschke, Jonathan M.; Itescu, Yuval] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Berlin, Germany; [Jeschke, Jonathan M.; Voigt, Christian C.; Itescu, Yuval] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, Berlin, Germany; [Voigt, Christian C.] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res IZW, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Universitat Greifswald; Leibniz Association; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Leibniz Institut fur Zoo und Wildtierforschung,"Wolf, JM (corresponding author), Univ Greifswald, Inst Zool, Loitzer Str 26, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",janis.wolf@gmx.de,"Jeschke, Jonathan/A-2707-2008; Wolf, Janis/HJP-3830-2023","Voigt, Christian/0000-0002-0706-3974; Wolf, Janis Maximilian/0000-0003-0560-6354; Itescu, Yuval/0000-0002-6301-7112; Jeschke, Jonathan/0000-0003-3328-4217",Alexander von Humboldt--Stiftung; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [GRK 2118/1-2],Alexander von Humboldt--Stiftung(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Alexander von Humboldt--Stiftung; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: GRK 2118/1-2",,98,18,18,4,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Certain combinations of fruit traits that determine the interaction with specific seed dispersers are known as dispersal syndromes. The dispersal syndrome hypothesis (DSH) states that seed dispersers influence the combination of fruit traits found in fruits. Therefore, fruit traits can predict the type of dispersers with which plant species interact. Here, we analysed whether relationships of fruit traits can be explained by the DSH. To do so, we estimated the inter-relationships between morphological, chemical and display groups of fruit traits. In addition, we tested the importance of each trait group defining seed dispersal syndromes. Methods Using phylogenetically corrected fruit trait data and fruit-seed disperser networks, we tested the relationships among morphological, chemical and display fruit traits with Pearson's correlations and phenotypic integration indices. Then, we used perMANOVA to test if the fruit traits involved in the analysis supported the functional types of seed dispersers. Key Results Morphological traits showed strong intragroup relationships, in contrast to chemical and display traits whose intragroup trait relationships were weak or null. Accordingly, only the morphological group of traits supported three broad seed disperser functional types (birds, terrestrial mammals and bats), consistent with the DSH. Conclusions Altogether, our results give some support to the DSH. Here, the three groups of traits interacted in different ways with seed disperser biology. Broad functional types of seed dispersers would adjust fruit consumption to anatomical limitations imposed by fruit morphology. Once this anatomical filter is sovercome, seed dispersers use almost all the range of variation in chemical and display fruit traits. This suggests that the effect of seed dispersers on fruit traits is modulated by hierarchical decisions. First, morphological constraints define which interactions can actually occur; subsequently, display and composition determine fruit preferences.","[Nicolas Rojas, Tobias; Blendinger, Pedro G.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Inst Ecol Reg, CC 34, RA-4107 Yerba Buena, Tucuman, Argentina; [Nicolas Rojas, Tobias; Blendinger, Pedro G.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CC 34, RA-4107 Yerba Buena, Tucuman, Argentina; [Catiana Zampini, Iris; Ines Isla, Maria] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Inst Bioprospecc & Fisiol Vegetal, San Lorenzo 1469, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Catiana Zampini, Iris; Ines Isla, Maria] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, San Lorenzo 1469, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Catiana Zampini, Iris; Ines Isla, Maria; Blendinger, Pedro G.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Ciencias Nat, Miguel Lille 2005, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Catiana Zampini, Iris; Ines Isla, Maria; Blendinger, Pedro G.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Inst Miguel Lillo, Miguel Lille 2005, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina",Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Miguel Lillo Foundation; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman,"Rojas, TN (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Tucuman, Inst Ecol Reg, CC 34, RA-4107 Yerba Buena, Tucuman, Argentina.;Rojas, TN (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CC 34, RA-4107 Yerba Buena, Tucuman, Argentina.",tobiasnrojas@gmail.com,"Rojas, Tobias Nicolas/LBH-6622-2024","Isla, Maria Ines/0000-0002-4261-4284; Blendinger, Pedro G./0000-0002-2130-9934","National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONCyT); National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), Argentina; FONCyT [PICT 2013-1280]; CONICET [PIP 2014-592]","National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONCyT)(FONCyT); National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), Argentina(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); FONCyT(FONCyT); CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET))","T.N.R. was supported by doctoral fellowships from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONCyT), and the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), Argentina.

Bats are essential components of ecosystems and are useful bio-indicators of habitat disturbance, yet the response and vulnerability of bats to fragmentation have been poorly studied in Africa. We aim to assess the effects of forest biogeographical history and fragmentation on functional diversity of bats and their functional traits. Location Eastern Cape and southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Taxon Insectivorous bats. Methods We surveyed forest-utilizing bats to derive four functional diversity indices. Generalized linear models were used to assess the response of diversity indices to biogeographical history and fragmentation, represented by forest type and five landscape fragmentation metrics. RLQ and fourth-corner analysis were used to investigate the interaction of traits with fragmentation metrics and forest type. Results Pondoland Scarp forests displayed high functional richness, while Eastern Cape Dune forests exhibited high functional divergence yet low functional richness and dispersion. Two fragmentation metrics affected functional diversity dynamically: edge density had a positive effect on functional evenness; and dispersion was negatively affected by river length through forests. Results showed stronger interactions of functional traits with forest type than fragmentation metrics, with filtering effects on body size and wing morphology. Main conclusions The large-scale processes related to biogeographical history, and associated forest structure, are important determinants of functional richness, divergence and dispersion of insectivorous bat communities. Scarp forests showed the highest species and functional richness as they experienced less extreme climatic extinction filtering than Mistbelt forests during the Last Glacial Maximum, whereas the low diversity of Eastern Cape Dune forests results from their younger evolutionary history and homogenous vegetation structure. Little is known of the sensitivity of bats to habitat fragmentation in Africa: here, we show larger-sized insectivorous species; and species exhibiting low wing loading may be more vulnerable to fragmentation.","[Moir, Monika; Rambau, Ramugondo V.; Cherry, Michael I.] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Richards, Leigh R.] Durban Nat Sci Museum, POB 4085, Durban, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Moir, M (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Nat Sci Bldg,Merriman Ave, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",monikamoir@gmail.com,"Richards, Leigh/AAU-6488-2021; Moir, Monika/AAU-6520-2021","Moir, Monika/0000-0003-1095-1910",Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme,Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme,Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme,,75,9,10,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

However, an extensive compilation of their functional traits and ecological attributes is still missing. Here we present EuroBaTrait 1.0, the most comprehensive and up-to-date trait dataset covering 47 European bat species. The dataset includes data on 118 traits including genetic composition, physiology, morphology, acoustic signature, climatic associations, foraging habitat, roost type, diet, spatial behaviour, life history, pathogens, phenology, and distribution. We compiled the bat trait data obtained from three main sources: (i) a systematic literature and dataset search, (ii) unpublished data from European bat experts, and (iii) observations from large-scale monitoring programs. EuroBaTrait is designed to provide an important data source for comparative and trait-based analyses at the species or community level. The dataset also exposes knowledge gaps in species, geographic and trait coverage, highlighting priorities for future data collection.","[Froidevaux, Jeremy S.

Recent work has suggested fruit traits can represent adaptations to broad groups of functionally similar frugivores, but the role of frugivore traits and within-species variation in structuring fruit consumption is less understood. To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the presence of reciprocal trait matching for the mutualistic ecological network comprising of Carollia bats that feed on and disperse Piper seeds. We used generalized joint attribute modeling (GJAM), a Bayesian modeling approach that simultaneously accounts for multiple sources of variance across trait types. In support of frugivore adaptation to their dietary composition and suggesting niche partitioning among Carollia bats, we find differential consumption of a suite of Piper species influenced by bat traits such as body size; however, the Piper morphological traits considered had no effect on bat consumption. Slow evolutionary rates, dispersal by other vertebrates, and unexamined fruit traits, such as Piper chemical bouquets, may explain the lack of association between bat Piper consumption and fruit morphological traits. We have identified a potential asymmetric influence of frugivore traits on plant-frugivore interactions, providing a template for future trait analyses of plant-animal networks. As intraspecific trait variation is rarely included in studies on trait matching, this paper contributes to closing that important knowledge gap.","[Yohe, Laurel R.] Univ North Carolina, Dept Bioinformat & Genom, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Yohe, Laurel R.] North Carolina Res Campus, Kannapolis, NC 28081 USA; [Yohe, Laurel R.; Davalos, Liliana M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Yohe, Laurel R.] Yale Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Leiser-Miller, Leith B.; Kaliszewska, Zofia A.; Santana, Sharlene E.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA USA; [Whitehead, Susan R.] Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Sci, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Santana, Sharlene E.] Univ Washington, Burke Museum Nat Hist & Culture, Seattle, WA USA; [Davalos, Liliana M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Consortium Interdisciplinary Environm Res, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; Yale University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University,"Yohe, LR (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina, Dept Bioinformat & Genom, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.;Yohe, LR (corresponding author), North Carolina Res Campus, Kannapolis, NC 28081 USA.;Yohe, LR; Dávalos, LM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;Yohe, LR (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Dávalos, LM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Consortium Interdisciplinary Environm Res, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",lyohe1@charlotte.edu; liliana.davalos@stonybrook.edu,"Yohe, Laurel/H-4557-2019; Davalos, Liliana/AEE-7879-2022; Whitehead, Susan/ADZ-3242-2022; Kaliszewska, Zofia/K-1528-2013","Kaliszewska, Zofia/0000-0001-6917-8665; Yohe, Laurel/0000-0003-1567-8749; Davalos, Liliana/0000-0002-4327-7697","Division of Biological Infrastructure [DEB-1442142, DEB-1456375, DEB-1856776]; National Science Foundation [NSF DBI-1812035]; Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology",Division of Biological Infrastructure(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology,"This project was made possible by the scientists and administrators at La Selva Biological Research Station in Sarapiqui, Costa Rica.

However, the geographical barriers between continents should have resulted in intraspecific population differentiation with reflection on individual biological and ecological traits. Our aim was to test for potential differences in Chironomidae species/genus and traits between the Nearctic and Palearctic regions. We compared the Chironomidae trait information gathered in two databases; one database was developed in Europe and the other in North America. Common genera and species of both databases were selected, and the common traits were adjusted into the same trait categories. Data were transformed into presence/absence and divided into Eltonian (biological/functional) and Grinnellian (ecological) traits. Common genera and common species were analyzed using Fuzzy correspondence analysis (FCA). Differences between databases occur for all trait domains. Yet, Eltonian traits showed lower level of concordance than Grinnellian traits at the species level. Different biological characteristics in the Nearctic and Palearctic regions may indicate that Chironomidae have different adaptions to similar ecological environments due to intraspecific variability or even trait plasticity.","[Serra, Sonia R.

If particular functional traits characterize the favored plant species, then defaunation may alter community-wide patterns of functional trait composition. Changes in plant functional traits occurring with defaunation may help identify the species interactions affected by defaunation and the potential for other cascading effects of defaunation. We tested the hypotheses that defaunation would (1) disrupt seed dispersal, thereby favoring species whose dispersal agents are not affected (e.g., small birds, bats, and abiotic agents), (2) reduce seed predation, thereby favoring larger-seeded species, and (3) reduce herbivory, thereby favoring species with lower leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf toughness, and wood density. We examined how these six traits responded to vertebrate defaunation caused by hunters or by experimental exclosures among more than 30000 woody seedlings in a lowland tropical moist forest. Exclosures reduced terrestrial frugivores, granivores, and herbivores, while hunters also reduced volant and arboreal frugivores and granivores. The comparison of exclosures and hunting allowed us to parse the impacts of arboreal and volant species (reduced by hunters only) and terrestrial species (reduced by both hunters and exclosures). The loss of terrestrial vertebrates alone had limited effects on plant trait composition. The additional loss of volant and arboreal vertebrates caused significant shifts in plant species composition towards communities with more species dispersed abiotically, including lianas and low wood-density tree species, and fewer species dispersed by large vertebrates. In contrast to previous studies, community seed mass did not decline significantly in hunted sites. Our exclosure results suggest this is because reducing seed predators disproportionately benefits large-seeded species, partially compensating for the reduction of seed dispersers at hunted sites. Our results demonstrate that decreased seed dispersal and seed predation are important determinants of seedling community compositional change as a consequence of defaunation. Defaunation may also negatively impact carbon storage in tropical forests, by favoring lianas and low wood density tree species.","[Kurten, Erin L.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wright, S.

Here, we compared multiple dimensions of alpha- and beta- bat biodiversity between four natural Amazonian habitats (savannah, campinarana, forest patches, and continuous forest). In addition, we explored the extent to which bat communities in the different habitats are nested within one another, and compared the community-level functional uniqueness and community-weighted mean traits between habitats. Our results show that taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic alpha-diversity of bats is higher in continuous forest than in any of the other habitat types. The continuous forest also harbours more unique species, and indeed, the bat community assemblages in the less-complex habitats, including forest patches, campinarana and savannahs, are taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic sub-sets of the assemblage found in the continuous forest. By examining beta-diversity partitions and species composition, we are able to shed light on the mechanisms behind the variation in diversity between the four habitat types, which reflect a process of environmental sorting along a habitat gradient going from a more complex to a less complex habitat. We conclude that nesting patterns along the mosaic of habitats are determined by differences in complexity between habitats and that taxonomic and functional uniqueness contribute to overall regional bat diversity and functionality. Ongoing human-induced disturbances of these habitats could provoke an unprecedented loss of bat diversity and functionality with negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services.","[Carvalho, William Douglas; Hilaro, Renato R.; de Toledo, Jose Julio] Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade Trop, Rod Juscelino Kubitscheck,Km 2, BR-68903419 Macapa, AP, Brazil; [Carvalho, William Douglas] Univ Fed Grande Dourados UFGD, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade & Meio Ambiente, Rodovia Dourados Itahum,Km 12, BR-79804970 Dourados, MS, Brazil; [Carvalho, William Douglas; Hilaro, Renato R.; de Toledo, Jose Julio] Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Dept Meio Ambiente & Desenvolvimento, Lab Ecol, Rod Juscelino Kubitscheck,Km 2, BR-68903419 Macapa, AP, Brazil; [Mustin, Karen] Univ Fed Pelotas, Inst Biol, Dept Ecol Zool & Genet, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, BR-96010900 Pelotas, RS, Brazil; [Farneda, Fabio Z.] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Ecol & Evolut, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [de Castro, Isai Jorge] Inst Pesquisas Cient & Tecnol Estado Amapa IEPA, Lab Mamiferos, Rodovia JK,Km 10, BR-68912250 Macapa, AP, Brazil; [Moreira Martins, Ana Carolina] Inst Chico Mendes Conservacao Biodiversidade ICMB, Coordenacao Identificacao & Planejamento Acoes Co, EQSW 103-104,Bloco C,Complexo Adm Setor Sudoeste, BR-70670350 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Miguel, Joao D.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Miguel, Joao D.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Xavier, Bruna da Silva] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Av Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941971 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Fundacao Universidade Federal do Amapa; Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados; Fundacao Universidade Federal do Amapa; Universidade Federal de Pelotas; Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Carvalho, WD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade Trop, Rod Juscelino Kubitscheck,Km 2, BR-68903419 Macapa, AP, Brazil.;Carvalho, WD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Grande Dourados UFGD, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade & Meio Ambiente, Rodovia Dourados Itahum,Km 12, BR-79804970 Dourados, MS, Brazil.;Carvalho, WD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Dept Meio Ambiente & Desenvolvimento, Lab Ecol, Rod Juscelino Kubitscheck,Km 2, BR-68903419 Macapa, AP, Brazil.",wilruoca@hotmail.com,"Farneda, Fabio/L-9402-2013; Mustin, Karen/J-3186-2019; Xavier, Bruna/K-2260-2016; Hilário, Renato/A-7158-2013; Castro, Isai/I-5094-2013; Mustin, Karen/F-8070-2013; Carvalho, William Douglas/H-7894-2015; Toledo, Jose Julio/V-2465-2019","Castro, Isai/0000-0003-2924-7886; Mustin, Karen/0000-0002-2828-2316; Carvalho, William Douglas/0000-0003-2518-9148; Zanella Farneda, Fabio/0000-0001-6765-2861; Xavier, Bruna/0000-0001-9390-5041; Toledo, Jose Julio/0000-0002-1778-0117; Hilario, Renato/0000-0002-0346-0921",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES PNPD) [001]; Ecology and Environment do Brasil; Group Isolux,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES PNPD)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Ecology and Environment do Brasil; Group Isolux,"William Douglas Carvalho and Fabio Zanella Farneda are supported by a post-doctoral scholarship from CoordenacAo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES PNPD and PrInt-Finance Code 001, respectively).

Damming interrupts the continuity of the river and produces the flooding of adjacent terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the negative effects on terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity, studies of the impacts of hydroelectric dams on species and community functional responses to flooding are scarce. Here, we evaluated the effects of river damming on taxonomic and functional diversity of phyllostomid bats sampled before (flooded sites) and after (unflooded sites) the construction of a mega hydroelectric dam in the southwestern of the Brazilian Amazon. The flooding of the lowlands significantly increased the taxonomic and functional alpha-diversity, as well as the species- and the community-level functional uniqueness of the bat assemblages, reflecting a reduction in the abundance of functional redundant species. Based on functional trait composition, we detected an increase in the frequency of animalivorous bats, and a reduction in phytophagous bats. Pre- and post-dam temporal differences show that functional beta-diversity shifts were more determined by replacement of traits weighted by species abundance than by the loss or gain of traits. Functional traits linked to trophic level, body mass, and diet proved to be powerful indicators of the bat community's responses to temporal changes caused by run-of-the-river dams, which degrade riparian and varzea forests. Plans to expand the electric power matrix in Brazil include the construction of several dams, potentially flooding large areas of varzea forests. We demonstrate the importance of the varzea and the riparian forests to phytophagous bats to guarantee the ecological functions they perform.","[Bobrowiec, Paulo Estefano D.] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazon INPA, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Farneda, Fabio Z.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Medellin, Colombia; [Nobre, Carla Clarissa] Univ Fed Minas Gerais UFMG, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Tavares, Valeria da Cunha] Inst Tecnol Vale, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Tavares, Valeria da Cunha] Univ Fed Paraiba UFPB, Programa Posgrad Biol Zool, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Instituto Tecnologico Vale Desenvolvimento Sustentavel; Universidade Federal da Paraiba,"Bobrowiec, PED (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazon INPA, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",paulobobro@gmail.com,"Farneda, Fabio/L-9402-2013; Bobrowiec, Paulo/A-2630-2013; Tavares, Valeria/G-4654-2012","Tavares, Valeria/0000-0003-0966-0139; Nobre, Carla Clarissa/0000-0003-2704-6239; Zanella Farneda, Fabio/0000-0001-6765-2861",Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Santo Antonio Energia; Fundacao Amazonica de Defesa da Biosfera; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas,Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Santo Antonio Energia; Fundacao Amazonica de Defesa da Biosfera; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas,"This work was supported by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Santo Antonio Energia, Fundacao Amazonica de Defesa da Biosfera, Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas.

Landscape features may drive the functional role variability of bat species on the ecosystems. Consequently, landscapes may change the degree of functional differentiation between species. We have evaluated the effect of pine forest monoculture and their environmental characteristics on the distribution and functional attributes of bat species. We sampled bat communities in areas with high (three sites) and low (three sites) forest land use management practices including six mist-netting locations in order to sample for bats at each site. In addition, we have also measured temperature, humidity, percentage of land use coverage (managed forest, agriculture, and native forest), and percentage of canopy openness at each site. We captured 87 bats belonging to eight species representing two families: Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae. For the functional analysis, we used three functional attributes to describe wing morphology: wing loading, aspect ratio, and forearm length. No significant effect of any environmental variable was observed on bat species composition. However, bat species distribution was driven by the ability associated with their functional attributes to occupy the space. Moreover, forearm length was positively correlated with forest cover, canopy openness, and humidity. Species with similar wing morphology have responded in a similar way to environmental variables in the studied areas. Functional dispersion was high in the native forest. The monoculture of exotic species may increase the functional attributes related with vulnerability as described by bat wing morphology. Therefore, the native forest conversion to pine forest monoculture may increase the loss of functional attributes in the bat community.","[Biassi, David Liposki; Baldissera, Ronei; Rezende, Renan de Souza] Univ Comunitaria Regiao Chapeco UNOCHAPECO, Programa Posgrad Cieneias Ambientais, Rua Servidao Anjo Guarda 295-D, BR-89809000 Chapeco, SC, Brazil; [Galiano, Daniel] Univ Fed Fronteira Sul, Lab Zool, Campus Realeza,Rua Edmundo Gaievisk 1000, BR-85770000 Realeza, PR, Brazil",Universidade Comunitaria Regional de Chapeco; Universidade Federal da Fronteira Sul,"Biassi, DL (corresponding author), Univ Comunitaria Regiao Chapeco UNOCHAPECO, Programa Posgrad Cieneias Ambientais, Rua Servidao Anjo Guarda 295-D, BR-89809000 Chapeco, SC, Brazil.",davidbatsc@hotmail.com,"Rezende, Renan/I-5165-2014; Galiano, Daniel/O-1671-2013","Rezende, Renan/0000-0002-4129-0863; Galiano, Daniel/0000-0003-1428-8634",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Universidade Comunitaria da Regiao de Chapeco (UNOCHAPECO); CAPES,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Universidade Comunitaria da Regiao de Chapeco (UNOCHAPECO); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"We are grateful to all our colleagues at the Laboratorio de Ecologia e Quimica da Unochapeco for their support at various stages of this research.

Despite the importance of regenerating secondary forests for tropical biodiversity conservation, studies of temporal effects of matrix regeneration on species responses in fragmented landscapes are scarce. Here, we used an Amazonian whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment to investigate how changes in matrix quality over time through secondary forest regeneration affect bat assemblages from a functional perspective. We found that forest regeneration in the matrix positively affected functional a diversity, as well as species- and community-level functional uniqueness, reflecting an increase of species that perform different ecological functions in secondary forest over time. According to functional trait composition, animalivorous species showed the clearest signs of recovery associated with matrix regeneration. Consequently, between-period differences in functional beta-diversity were highest in secondary forest compared to fragments and continuous forest, determined mainly by trait gains. However, similar to 30 years of secondary forest regeneration were not sufficient for the functional recovery of bat assemblages to levels observed in continuous forest. Restoring degraded habitats while protecting primary forest will be an important strategy for safeguarding high functional diversity of bats and their vital contributions to ecosystem functioning in fragmented tropical landscapes.","[Farneda, Fabio Z.; Grelle, Carlos E.

To understand the role of phylogenetic relatedness in structuring responses to rapid environmental change, we focused on assemblages of Neotropical bats, an ecologically diverse and functionally important group. We examined how taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity shift between tropical forest and farmland. We then explored the importance of evolutionary history by ascertaining whether close relatives share similar responses to environmental change and which species traits might mediate these trends. We analyzed a 5-year data set (5,011 captures) from 18 sites in a countryside landscape in southern Costa Rica using statistical models that account and correct for imperfect detection of species across sites, spatial autocorrelation, and consideration of spatial scale. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity decreased with deforestation, and assemblages became more phylogenetically clustered. Species' responses to deforestation were strongly phylogenetically correlated. Body mass and absolute wing loading explained a substantial portion of species variation in species' habitat preferences, likely related to these traits' influence on maneuverability in cluttered forest environments. Our findings highlight the role that evolutionary history plays in determining which species will survive human impacts and the need to consider diversity metrics, evolutionary history, and traits together when making predictions about species persistence for conservation or ecosystem functioning.","[Frank, Hannah K.; Frishkoff, Luke O.; Mendenhall, Chase D.; Daily, Gretchen C.; Hadly, Elizabeth A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Frishkoff, Luke O.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Frishkoff, Luke O.; Mendenhall, Chase D.; Daily, Gretchen C.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Conservat Biol, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mendenhall, Chase D.] Nature Conservancy, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Daily, Gretchen C.; Hadly, Elizabeth A.] Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hadly, Elizabeth A.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Innovat Global Hlth, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; University of Toronto; Stanford University; Nature Conservancy; Stanford University,"Frank, HK (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hannah.kim.frank@gmail.com,"Hay, Elizabeth/HKF-8621-2023; Frishkoff, Luke/H-8680-2019; Frank, Hannah/AAG-6502-2021","Frishkoff, Luke/0000-0001-5738-2140; Frank, Hannah/0000-0002-4507-181X",Moore Family Foundation; Winslow Foundation; Stanford Woods Institute; Stanford Center for Conservation Biology; Bing-Mooney Fellowship in Environmental Science and Conservation; University of Toronto Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Postdoctoral Fellowship; Ward Wilson Woods Jr. Fellowship in Environmental Studies; NatureNet Science Fellowship; Bing-Ehrlich Fellowship in Environmental Science and Conservation,Moore Family Foundation; Winslow Foundation; Stanford Woods Institute; Stanford Center for Conservation Biology; Bing-Mooney Fellowship in Environmental Science and Conservation; University of Toronto Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Postdoctoral Fellowship; Ward Wilson Woods Jr. Fellowship in Environmental Studies; NatureNet Science Fellowship; Bing-Ehrlich Fellowship in Environmental Science and Conservation,"We thank J.

In the face of climate change, many of these species are being pushed higher to escape ever-increasing temperatures. Despite this, we have little understanding of how species distribute themselves across mountains. African mountains in particular are less studied than mountains elsewhere and the small mammal groups that inhabit them are also poorly studied when compared to other groups. In this study, we examined the responses of three functionally distinct small mammal taxonomic groups to changes in elevation across Africa.LocationAfrica.MethodsWe calculated four functional diversity metrics for 166, 97 and 153 communities of rodents, bats and shrews comprising 225, 183 and 109 species, respectively. We employed RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to identify any associations between the functional traits of the small mammals and elevation and other climatic variables.ResultsWe show that the species richness of the three taxa responded differently to increases in elevation, with only rodents showing a mid-elevational hump. The composition of rodent and bat communities differed significantly in upland versus lowland sites, but bat communities showed far more overlap across the elevational gradient. Functional diversity metrics responded differently for each taxon highlighting the importance of using different taxonomic groups when studying elevational patterns of functional diversity.Main ConclusionsOur study shows that functional divergence increases with elevation in all three taxa, indicating a pervasive and broadly applicable strong environmental filtering at higher elevations. Our findings suggest that species at higher elevations may be at higher risk due to specialization. These species are losing habitat due to ongoing climate change that will force them up the elevational gradient. At the same time, the human population in Africa is predicted to triple in size by the year 2100, which will also likely contribute to further habitat loss and fragmentation. As small mammals often play essential roles in ecosystems, from seed dispersal to soil aeration and predation, understanding the susceptibility of the specialization of species at higher elevations is crucial for the effective conservation and management of mountain ecosystems, especially in light of climatic change and human expansion.","[Monadjem, Ara] Univ Eswatini, Dept Biol Sci, Kwaluseni, Eswatini; [Monadjem, Ara] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Pretoria, South Africa; [Farooq, Harith] Univ Copenhagen, Globe Inst, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Farooq, Harith] Lurio Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Pemba, Mozambique; [Farooq, Harith] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg Global Biodivers Ctr, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kane, Adam] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin, Ireland",University of Pretoria; University of Copenhagen; University of Gothenburg; University College Dublin,"Monadjem, A (corresponding author), Univ Eswatini, Dept Biol Sci, Kwaluseni, Eswatini.",aramonadjem@gmail.com,"Kane, Adam/H-6449-2013; Monadjem, Ara/K-7279-2014","Kane, Adam/0000-0002-2830-5338; Monadjem, Ara/0000-0003-1906-4023",The Danish Independent Research Council,The Danish Independent Research Council,Thank you to the three reviewers who provided valuable comments on our manuscript.,,77,2,2,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

These two mechanisms enable trees to cope with rapid climate change. We studied two European temperate tree species (sessile oak and European beech), focusing on (i) in situ variations of leaf functional traits (morphological and physiological) along two altitudinal gradients and (ii) the extent to which these variations were under environmental and/or genetic control using a common garden experiment. For all traits, altitudinal trends tended to be highly consistent between species and transects. For both species, leaf mass per area displayed a positive linear correlation with altitude, whereas leaf size was negatively correlated with altitude. We also observed a significant increase in leaf physiological performance with increasing altitude: populations at high altitudes had higher maximum rates of assimilation, stomatal conductance and leaf nitrogen content than those at low altitudes. In the common garden experiment, genetic differentiation between populations accounted for 0-28% of total phenotypic variation. However, only two traits (leaf mass per area and nitrogen content) exhibited a significant cline. The combination of in situ and common garden experiments used here made it possible to demonstrate, for both species, a weaker effect of genetic variation than of variations in natural conditions, suggesting a strong effect of the environment on leaf functional traits. Finally, we demonstrated that intrapopulation variability was systematically higher than interpopulation variability, whatever the functional trait considered, indicating a high potential capacity to adapt to climate change.","[Bresson, Caroline C.; Vitasse, Yann; Kremer, Antoine; Delzon, Sylvain] Univ Bordeaux, UMR BIOGECO 1202, F-33405 Talence, France; [Bresson, Caroline C.; Kremer, Antoine; Delzon, Sylvain] INRA, UMR BIOGECO 1202, F-33610 Cestas, France",Universite de Bordeaux; INRAE,"Delzon, S (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, UMR BIOGECO 1202, Bat B8,Ave Fac, F-33405 Talence, France.",sylvain.delzon@u-bordeaux1.fr,"Delzon, Sylvain/R-9538-2018; Kremer, Antoine/G-2272-2018; Vitasse, Yann/K-3349-2017","Delzon, Sylvain/0000-0003-3442-1711; Kremer, Antoine/0000-0002-3372-3235; Vitasse, Yann/0000-0002-7454-505X",Aquitaine; Midi-Pyrenees region; BACCARA; European Community [226299]; ONF,Aquitaine; Midi-Pyrenees region(Region Occitanie); BACCARA; European Community; ONF,"This study was supported by a grant of the Aquitaine and Midi-Pyrenees regions and the BACCARA project, which received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 226299.

Most previous studies used proxies rather than actual climate and land-use data, and their interactions are rarely explored. We investigate whether higher summer average temperatures are driving decreasing bat body size as predicted by Bergmann's rule or increasing appendage size as per Allen's rule. We also explore whether temperature or resource availability (namely forest cover) is responsible for changes in wing functional traits. Using land-use data from historical maps and national statistics combined with climatic data, we assessed the effect of temperature and resource availability on bat morphology. We used 464 museum specimens of three bat species (Eptesicus nilssonii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus, and Plecotus auritus), spanning 180 years, across a 1200 km latitudinal gradient. We found no evidence of higher summer average temperatures driving decreases in body size in bats. Jaw sizes of P. auritus and P. pygmaeus changed over time but in different directions. The geographical variation of forest cover was also related to differences in wing functional traits in two species. Crucially, there was a significant antagonistic interactive effect of forest and temperature on tip index in P. pygmaeus whereby above 14.5 C the relationship between forest and tip index actually reversed. This could indicate that higher temperatures promote more pointed wings, which may provide energetic benefits. Our results show the importance of including both climatic and land-use variables when assessing trends in bat morphology and exploring interactions. Encouragingly, all three species have shown an ability to adapt their body size and functional traits to different conditions, and it could demonstrate their potential to overcome future negative impacts of climate and land-use change.","[Wood, Heather; Cousins, Sara A.

Here, we disentangle the direct and indirect effects of abiotic drivers (climatic conditions, and land use) and biotic drivers (vegetation structure and food resources) on functional diversity and composition of bird and bat assemblages along a tropical elevational gradient. Location Southern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, East Africa. Methods We counted birds and recorded bat sonotypes on 58 plots distributed in near-natural and anthropogenically modified habitats from 700 to 4,600 m above sea level. For the recorded taxa, we compiled functional traits related to movement, foraging and body size from museum specimens and databases. Further, we recorded mean annual temperature, precipitation, vegetation complexity as well as the number of fruits, flowers, and insect biomass as measures of resource availability on each study site. Results Using path analyses, we found similar responses of bird and bat functional diversity to the variation in abiotic and biotic drivers along the elevational gradient. In contrast, the functional composition of both taxa showed distinct responses to abiotic and biotic drivers. For both groups, direct temperature effects were most important, followed by resource availability, precipitation and vegetation complexity. Main Conclusions Our findings indicate that physiological and metabolic constraints imposed by temperature and resource availability determine the functional diversity of bird and bat assemblages, whereas the composition of individual functional traits is driven by taxon-specific processes. Our study illustrates that distinct filtering mechanisms can result in similar patterns of functional diversity along broad environmental gradients. Such differences need to be taken into account when it comes to conserving the functional diversity of flying vertebrates on tropical mountains.","[Byamungu, Robert Modest] Sokoine Univ Agr, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Byamungu, Robert Modest; Schleuning, Matthias; Ferger, Stefan W.; Neu, Alexander; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin; Albrecht, Joerg] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, Frankfurt, Germany; [Byamungu, Robert Modest; Helbig-Bonitz, Maria; Vogeler, Anna; Tschapka, Marco] Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Ulm, Germany; [Hemp, Andreas] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Systemat, Bayreuth, Germany; [Boehning-Gaese, Katrin] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Biol Sci, Frankfurt, Germany; [Tschapka, Marco] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa Ancon, Panama",Sokoine University of Agriculture; Leibniz Association; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Ulm University; University of Bayreuth; Goethe University Frankfurt; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Byamungu, RM (corresponding author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Wildlife Management, POB 3073, Morogoro, Tanzania.",robertbmodest@yahoo.com,"Böhning-Gaese, Katrin/W-2601-2019; Neu, Alexander/AAB-4244-2019; Albrecht, Jorg/ABG-9491-2021; Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015","Albrecht, Jorg/0000-0002-9708-9413; Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X","DFG [BO-1221/16-3, SCHL 1934/2-3, TS81/5-3, FOR 1246]",DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"DFG Research Unit FOR 1246: Kilimanjaro ecosystems under global change: Linking biodiversity, biotic interactions and biogeochemical ecosystem processes.

We assessed vine leaf decomposition by Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille, 1804), a terrestrial isopod widely distributed and naturally present in vineyards. We compared the decomposition of three grape varieties (Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Sauvignon) with regular laboratory food (Tilia tomentosa (Moench, 1785)) for seven consecutive weeks. Seven traits were measured on the four litters tested in order to define their importance concerning (i) litter mass loss by the action of microor-ganisms and isopods (ii) the trophic traits (consumption and assimilation) and (iii) life-history traits (survival and growth) of A. vulgare. Thus, the chemical and physical traits (C/N ratio, tannin and fiber content, thickness) known to influence litter palatability and digestibility for decomposers were determined by standardized methods. In addition, the copper frequently used in viticulture as a fungicide which is potentially responsible for toxic effects on decomposers was measured by ICP-OES after litter mineralization in nitric acid. Our results showed a higher percentage of decomposability by microorganisms in litter with low cellulose content and C/N ratio. Higher isopod consumption and assimilation was found in the litters which is the poorest in tannin, lignin and copper contents. Variation of consumption according to litter was on average 1.5 to 2.7 lower for grape varieties compared to T. tomentosa litter. Assimilation was significantly lower with Pinot Noir than the other litters. To conclude, after seven weeks of experimentation, this study showed that if the growth and survival of woodlice were not affected by inter-varietal differences in vine leaf quality, their role in the decomposition process may be strongly modulated and reduced, especially after consumption of grape variety litters rich in copper, lignin and tannin.","[Mondet, Cecilia; Lafitte, Alexandra; Caubet, Yves; Richard, Freddie-Jeanne] Univ Poitiers, Equipe Ecol Evolut Symbiose, Lab Ecol & Biol Interact, CNRS,UMR 7267, Bat B31,3 Rue Jacques Ft,TSA 51106, F-86073 Poitiers 9, France; [Nahmani, Johanne] Univ Montpellier, CEFE, CNRS, EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Poitiers; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier,"Mondet, C (corresponding author), Univ Poitiers, Equipe Ecol Evolut Symbiose, Lab Ecol & Biol Interact, CNRS,UMR 7267, Bat B31,3 Rue Jacques Ft,TSA 51106, F-86073 Poitiers 9, France.",mondetcecilia@yahoo.fr,,,Ecole Doctorale Theodore Monod of the University of Poitiers,Ecole Doctorale Theodore Monod of the University of Poitiers,"This work was possible thanks to the thesis grant awarded to Cecilia Mondet from the Ecole Doctorale Theodore Monod of the University of Poitiers.

Bats may persist in those environments, but the mechanisms responsible for their adaptability and the spatial scales in which the landscape imposes environmental filtering remain poorly studied in the Neotropics. We tested the hypothesis that landscape composition interacts with the spatial scale to affect the functional diversity of phyllostomids in an urban-rural gradient. Based on functional traits, we calculated indices of functional richness, divergence, evenness, and community-weighted means of morphological traits, and classified species into functional groups. We evaluated the changes in those variables in response to forest, grassland, and urbanized areas at 0.5, 1.25, and 2km scales. The number of functional groups, functional richness, and functional evenness tended to be higher in areas far from cities and with higher forest cover, whereas functional divergence increased in more urbanized areas. Our results show that the mean value of wing loading in the assemblage was negatively associated with landscape transformation at several spatial scales. However, environmental filtering driven by grass cover was particularly robust at the 0.5km scale, affecting big-sized species with long-pointed wings. Retaining natural forest in cattle ranging systems at similar to 12 km(2) appears to favor the functional evenness and number of functional groups of phyllostomids. Recognizing the scale of the effect on phyllostomid functional responses appears to be a fundamental issue for elucidating the spatial extent to which phyllostomid conservation planning in urban-rural landscapes should be addressed.","[Ramirez-Mejia, Andres F.; Urbina-Cardona, J.

Thus, they have high potential in establishing reference conditions for river bioassessment and in providing functional information, especially when other macroinvertebrates are poorly represented. However, because of taxonomic difficulties and poor knowledge of traits, they are neglected in bioassessment programmes and kept at coarser taxonomic levels, reducing the discrimination power of invertebrate-based diagnostic tools. Here, we compared the efficiency of Chironomidae at the subfamily and genus levels and their biological traits (Eltonian and morphological) in the distinction between permanent (medium altitude and lowland) and temporary Mediterranean streams. We established a priori predictions on the expected Chironomidae trait categories in each stream type, conferring the best adaptations to particular environmental constraints. Genus composition (not subfamily) and respective trait categories differed among the three stream types. Both biological traits identified differences between stream types. Among Eltonian traits, diapause stages segregated permanent medium altitude from lowland and temporary stream assemblages, reflecting adaptations to temperature and flow regime variations. Substrate relation and size distinguished temporary from permanent stream assemblages, interpreted as an adaptation to unstable sediments and irregular flow regimes. Morphological traits associated with mobility and foraging (e.g., body setae, Lauterborn sensory organs) discriminated temporary from permanent stream assemblages, reflecting differences in temporal and spatial stream heterogeneity. The use of these morphological characteristics relying on the observation of few characteristics, offers an alternative to the use of Chironomidae Eltonian traits in bioassessment and ecological studies, without a need for high taxonomic expertise.","[Serra, Sonia R.

With world-wide changes in human land use, an important challenge for conservation biologists is to develop frameworks to predict how species will respond to landscape change. Environmental filtering, where different environments favour different species traits, has the potential to be a useful predictive framework. Therefore, it is important to advance our understanding of how species with different traits respond to environmental variables. 2. We investigated the distribution of microbats in a 1 000 000 ha agricultural region in southeastern Australia, with specific emphasis on the effects of tree density on bat species characterized by different sizes, wing shapes and echolocation frequencies. The study area is substantially cleared, and trees are continuing to decline because grazing inhibits tree regeneration. We monitored bat activity acoustically at 80 sites spanning a wide range of tree densities. We used regression modelling to quantify the response of bats to tree density and other ecological covariates, and RLQ analysis to assess how different traits correlated with various environmental gradients. 3. Total bat activity and species richness peaked at intermediate tree densities. Species composition was explained by tree density and the traits of individual species. Sites with low tree cover were dominated by large, fast-flying species, whereas sites with dense tree cover were dominated by smaller, highly manoeuvrable species. These findings are consistent with recent findings from other locations around the world. 4. Synthesis and applications. Trait-based predictive frameworks enable landscape managers to assess how different management strategies and landscape modifications are likely to affect different species. Here, we propose a framework to derive general predictions of how bats respond to landscape modification, based on tree density and species traits. We apply this framework to a current conservation issue of tree decline in our study area and derive management priorities including: (i) maintaining a range of tree densities throughout the region; (ii) ensuring the persistence of locations with intermediate tree densities; and (iii) using environmentally sensitive grazing practices, for example, by incorporating long rest periods.","[Hanspach, Jan; Fischer, Joern] Univ Luneburg, Fac Sustainabil, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Hanspach, Jan; Fischer, Joern; Ikin, Karen; Stott, Jenny] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hanspach, Jan] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res UFZ, Dept Community Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Law, Bradley S.] NSW Primary Ind, Forest Sci Ctr, Beecroft, NSW 2119, Australia",Leuphana University Luneburg; Australian National University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW,"Hanspach, J (corresponding author), Univ Luneburg, Fac Sustainabil, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",jan.hanspach@uni.leuphana.de,"Law, Brad/IAQ-8054-2023; Ikin, Karen/G-2845-2012; Fischer, Joern/C-6625-2012","Law, Bradley/0000-0002-3991-3865; Fischer, Joern/0000-0003-3187-8978; Hanspach, Jan/0000-0002-6638-8699",Australian Research Council; SeaWorld and Busch Gardens Conservation Fund,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); SeaWorld and Busch Gardens Conservation Fund,"We thank all landholders who granted us access to their properties.

The development and growth of global species' trait databases are critical for improving trait-based analyses; however, it is vital to understand the gaps and biases in the available data. We reviewed bat wing morphology data, specifically mass, wingspan, wing area, wing loading, and aspect ratio, to identify issues with data reporting and ambiguity. Additionally, we aimed to assess taxonomic and geographic biases in trait data coverage. We found that most studies used similar field methodology, but that data reporting and quality were inconsistent/poor. Additionally, we noted several issues regarding semantic ambiguity in trait definitions, specifically around what constitutes wing area. Globally, we found that bat wing morphology trait coverage was low. Only six bat families had >= 40% trait coverage, and, of those, none consisted of more than 11 species in total. We found similar biases in trait coverage across International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categories, with threatened species having lower coverage. Geographically, North America, Europe, and the Indomalayan regions exhibited higher overall trait coverage, while both the Afrotropical and Neotropical ecoregions showed poor trait coverage. The underlying biases and gaps in bat wing morphology data have implications for researchers conducting global trait-based assessments. Implementing imputation techniques may address missing data, but only for smaller regional subsets with substantial trait coverage. Due to generally low overall trait coverage, increasing species' representation in the database should be prioritised. We suggest adopting an Ecological Trait Standard Vocabulary to reduce semantic ambiguity in bat wing morphology traits, to improve data compilation and clarity. Additionally, we advocate that researchers adopt an Open Science approach to facilitate the growth of a bat wing morphology trait database.","[Crane, Matt; Gale, George A.] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Conservat Ecol Program, 49 Thakham, Bangkok 10150, Thailand; [Silva, Ines] Ctr Adv Syst Understanding CASUS, Untermarkt 20, D-02826 Gorlitz, Germany; [Silva, Ines] Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf HZDR, Bautzner Landstr 400, D-01328 Dresden, Germany; [Grainger, Matthew J.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Postbox 5685 Torgarden, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway",King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR); Norwegian Institute Nature Research,"Crane, M (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Conservat Ecol Program, 49 Thakham, Bangkok 10150, Thailand.",mattecology@gmail.com; imss.silva@gmail.com; matthew.grainger@nina.no; ggkk1990@gmail.com,"Silva, Inês/AAG-2861-2020; Grainger, Matthew/K-6539-2019","Crane, Matthew/0000-0001-9197-5484; Grainger, Matthew/0000-0001-8426-6495",King Mongkut's Petchra Pra Jom Klao Scholarship,King Mongkut's Petchra Pra Jom Klao Scholarship,We would like the thank King Mongkut's Petchra Pra Jom Klao Scholarship for supporting the project.,,52,7,7,3,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,APR,2022,52,2,,,,,165,176,,10.1111/mam.12270,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.12270,,SEP 2021,12,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,ZN2WW,,Green Submitted,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000697445100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the induction of T-20 cricket matches, the strike rate of a batsman has gained much attention from coaches and team management. To increase the strike rate a batsman required to hit powerful shots for boundaries, which assist in making maximum scores at the minimum ball. Therefore, this investigation was planned to determine the effect of body size on the batting performance of cricket batsman. Methods: the literature for this study was selected for cricket coaching manual, cricket books, cricket batting videos, a biography of cricket batsmen, research articles. The academic documents were downloaded and shortlisted from Google Scholar, Research Gate, EBSCO, and ProQuest from 1990 to 2019. Results: The synthesized literature review concludes, stature, longer legs, longer arms, and lean body mass of a batsman show positive effects on the execution of powerful shots in cricket. Furthermore, the maximum strength of muscles assists a batsman to boost up the initial velocity of bat swing to accomplish the ball speed for a successful and powerful shot. Conclusions: Although stature and longer limbs of batsmen are associated with batting performance. On the other hand, the specific training would also enhance the capacity of cricket batsman for powerful shots in cricket. A future study was proposed to investigate the effect of training on the batting performance.","[Haq, Muhammad Zia Ul; Habib, Muhammad Badar] Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Dept Phys Educ & Sports Sci, Bahawalpur, Pakistan; [Nazeer, Muhammad Tahir] Univ Punjab, Dept Sports Sci & Phys Educ, Lahore, Pakistan; [Naveed, Muhammad Qasid] Univ Sargodha, Dept Sports Sci & Phys Educ, Sargodha, Pakistan; [Saeed, Muhammad Awais] Dept Youth Affairs Sports Archeol & Tourism, Sports Planning, Punjab, Pakistan; [Rajab, Sumeira] Univ Faisalabad, Govt Coll Women, Dept Hlth & Phys Educ, Faisalabad, Pakistan",Islamia University of Bahawalpur; University of Punjab; University of Sargodha,"Haq, MZU (corresponding author), Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Dept Phys Educ & Sports Sci, Bahawalpur, Pakistan.",,"Saeed, Muhammad Awais/J-4618-2018","Saeed, Muhammad Awais/0000-0003-4873-3679",,,,,41,1,1,0,6,IJPHY PUBLISHERS,ANDHRA PRADESH,"18-4-111A, RAILWAY COLONY, TIRUPATI-517501, ANDHRA PRADESH, 00000, INDIA",2349-5987,2348-8336,,INT J PHYSIOTHER,Int.

Bats are well-known potential deliverers of ecosystem services in agroecosystems through predation of pest arthropods that may affect crop production. Here we test the role of individual and prey traits in shaping the dietary habits of the Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii), a common bat species that frequently occurs in agroecosystems across the Mediterranean area, assessing diet composition and trait-based biases through molecular tools and multivariate testing techniques. DNA metabarcoding identified 173 distinct prey taxa in bats sampled in the Vesuvius National Park (Southern Italy). The diet was strongly dominated by pest insects associated with agricultural areas, which covered 57% of the overall prey diversity, some representing major pests of high economic relevance. The multivariate analyses detected strong relationships between diet composition, sampling date, and individual bat body conditions. Larger bats consumed larger prey items, and prey consumed later in the season (August) were smaller than those eaten in early summer (July) and were typical of less natural habitats. Hypsugo savii is potentially an important pest suppressor in the agroecosystems of the Mediterranean region and the functional relationships between the traits of individual bats and their prey set the basis for a quantitative assessment of the associated ecosystem service. We also remark on the value of bat diet studies in aiding the surveillance of arthropod species relevant to agriculture, human health, and biodiversity conservation.","[Ancillotto, Leonardo; Falanga, Angelica; Garonna, Antonio P.; de Benedetta, Flavia; Russo, Danilo] Univ Napoli Federico II, Lab Anim Ecol & Evolut AnEcoEvo, Dipartimento Agr, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Portici, Italy; [Agostinetto, Giulia; Tommasi, Nicola; Galimberti, Andrea] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Biotechnol & Biosci, ZooPlantLab, Piazza Sci 2, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [de Benedetta, Flavia; Bernardo, Umberto] CNR, Inst Sustainable Protect Plants, IPSP CNR, Ple E Fermi 1, I-80055 Portici, NA, Italy; [Conti, Paola] Ente Parco Nazl Vesuvio, Via Palazzo Principe, I-80044 Ottaviano, NA, Italy; [Russo, Danilo] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, 24 Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England",University of Naples Federico II; University of Milano-Bicocca; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la Protezione Sostenibile delle Piante (IPSP-CNR); University of Bristol,"Russo, D (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Lab Anim Ecol & Evolut AnEcoEvo, Dipartimento Agr, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Portici, Italy.",danrusso@unina.it,"Agostinetto, Giulia/JCD-9465-2023; Galimberti, Andrea/ABF-7019-2020; Garonna, Antonio/ABX-5698-2022; Bernardo, Umberto/P-9428-2015","de Benedetta, Flavia/0000-0002-5423-0536; Bernardo, Umberto/0000-0001-8190-2177; Russo, Danilo/0000-0002-1934-7130; GARONNA, Antonio Pietro/0000-0002-8441-5208","Vesuvius National Park; University of Naples Federico II, Italy [E79J21001380005]","Vesuvius National Park; University of Naples Federico II, Italy","We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for the useful comments made on a previous version of this article.

Fish species assemblages were recorded at 554 sampling sites, and the biological traits of species were described using a fuzzy-coding method. A co-inertia analysis of species distributions and biological traits identified some spatial patterns of species trait combinations. Fish species richness progressively increased from up- to downstream sections, and the longitudinal patterns of fish assemblages partitioned the river into clear bio-geographic areas, such as the brown trout Salmo trutta (headwater streams), the grayling Thymallus thymallus, the barbel Barbus bat-bus and the bream Abramis brama zones (most downstream sections), which fitted with Huet's well-known zonation for western European rivers. Only a few biological traits, chiefly related to life-history attributes, significantly influenced the observed fish distributions. Fecundity, potential size, maximum age and reproductive factor increased from headwater to plain reaches. As a theoretical framework for assessing and predicting the functional organization of stream fish communities, spatial variations in species traits can be related to habitat conditions, thus providing explicit spatial schemes that may be useful to the design of both scientific studies and river management.

It is tailored via evolution to suit conditions within the distribution range of each species, but the evolutionary drivers are not yet well-understood. Global patterns of humidity correlate with many aspects of bat ecology. We hypothesized that atmospheric absolute humidity could explain global peak frequency variation directly and indirectly via increasing species body size and bat species richness. These hypotheses were tested using Bayesian phylogenetic path analysis on 226 tropical and subtropical bat species. In line with our predictions, we found a positive total effect of humidity on peak frequency, which was dominated by the positive indirect effects via body size and bat species richness. We did not observe the negative direct effect of humidity on peak frequency, which was hypothesized based on atmospheric attenuation of sound. In line with our expectations, excluding the predominantly clutter foraging bat families from our dataset downplayed the importance of the richness-mediated route. To conclude, our findings suggest that indirect effects, owing to ecology and biogeography of bat taxa, play a major role in the global relationship between peak frequency and atmospheric humidity.","[Kotila, Miika] Univ Turku, Biodivers Unit, Turku, Finland; [Helle, Samuli] Univ Turku, Dept Social Res, Turku, Finland; [Lehto, Harry J.] Univ Turku, Dept Phys & Astron, Turku, Finland; [Rojas, Danny] Pontificia Univ Javeriana Cali, Dept Nat Sci & Math, Cali, Colombia; [Vesterinen, Eero J.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland; [Vesterinen, Eero J.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Lilley, Thomas M.] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Helsinki, Finland",University of Turku; University of Turku; University of Turku; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; University of Turku; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Helsinki,"Kotila, M (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Biodivers Unit, Turku, Finland.;Lilley, TM (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Helsinki, Finland.",mhkoti@utu.fi; thomas.lilley@helsinki.fi,"Vesterinen, Eero/Q-9527-2019; Lilley, Thomas/F-2236-2015","Lilley, Thomas/0000-0001-5864-4958; Vesterinen, Eero J./0000-0003-3665-5802",,,,,67,0,0,4,17,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

An important effect on bat behavior is given by canopy discontinuities like clearings or trails: while the former act as foraging sites, the latter are known to be used by bats to move inside the forest. For this reason, we can expect trails to have a strong influence on bat activity, with differences determined by the species' flying abilities. Here we assess the impact of trails on a local bat community by quantifying the effect of trails' characteristics on the activity of bat species in relation to their wing morphology. We collected paired acoustic data and environmental variables along trails and in internal areas of a forest in central Italy. We modelled the activity levels of three bat guilds differing in wing morphology and identified the species mostly responsible for the observed compositional dissimilarity in between trails and internal zones by adopting a multivariate approach. Trail width and tree's diameter were the main drivers of the observed differences between bat activity along trails and internal areas, but their effect differed among bat guilds. Edge and open-space foragers increased their activity along wider trails, while closed-space foragers showed an opposite trend; the latter also avoid trails in favor of internal areas especially when trees are larger. Four species yielded a significant contribution to the dissimilarity in activity levels between trails and internal areas, and namely Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Nyctalus noctula, Miniopterus schreibersii and Barbastella barbastellus. Our results show a clear effect of forest trails on bat activity, highlighting differences across functional groups in relation to trail characteristics. Furthermore, within guilds, not all species respond with the same intensity, suggesting differences in how different species are attracted to linear features and forest gaps. Overall, our results depict a complex interaction between forest trails and bat activity, suggesting that structural changes in forests can trigger diverse responses in bats. Future research on the topic may focus on assessing how such effects can affect bat communities at the landscape scale and longer time-scales.","[Saracino, D.; Santini, L.; Mirante, D.] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Viale Univ 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Ancillotto, L.] CNR, Ist Ric Ecosistemi Terr IRET, Via Madonna Piano 10, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Firenze, Italy; [Ancillotto, L.] Natl Biodivers Future Ctr, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sugli Ecosistemi Terrestri (IRET),"Saracino, D (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Viale Univ 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy.;Ancillotto, L (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Ric Ecosistemi Terr IRET, Via Madonna Piano 10, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Firenze, Italy.",saracinodaniele999@gmail.com; leonardo.ancillotto@cnr.it,,"Saracino, Daniele/0009-0009-5573-8209",,,The authors would like to thank Tenuta Sant'Egidio for the logistic support during this research.,,34,0,0,12,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Natural selection should act to minimize fluctuating asymmetry in traits that are most functionally important to an organism. Temperate-zone bats forage in night and therefore symmetry of wing bones should be very important to fitness. Bats use their hind limbs only for hanging in roosts, therefore asymmetry in the main leg bone, the tibia, should not be as significant to a bat's fitness. We predicted that there would be less fluctuating asymmetry in the forearms than in the tibia. We measured the forearms and tibias of 119 little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), and as predicted, forearm length did show less fluctuating asymmetry than tibia length.

One aspect of biodiversity, functional diversity, reflects the functional role of species within a community as measured by species characteristics. We present a new metric, functional trait dispersion, based on the concept of species distinctiveness measured as the distance among species in the multidimensional space defined by trait values. This metric can be decomposed into components of species richness, functional evenness and mean dispersion, and into parts that measure diversity within and among subgroups. 2. Using an appropriate distance measure, mean dispersion (M') is calculated as the average distance among all possible pairs of species. Functional evenness [E-q(T)] is derived from Hill diversity based on the proportional distances between pairs of species and species richness (S). Functional trait dispersion [D-q(TM)] is then computed as 1 + (S-1) x E-q(T) x M'. It has a range of [1, S] and measures the effective number of functionally distinct species for a given level of species dispersion. 3. Using constructed data, we demonstrate that D-q(TM) captures appropriate ecological properties such that a community with greater species richness, greater dispersal in trait space or greater mean dispersion has greater functional diversity. Functional trait dispersion can also provide measures of within-community dispersion and the effective number of functionally distinctive compartments (groups of communities with similar functional structure). Using empirical data of bats along an elevational gradient in Peru, we demonstrate that functional trait dispersion and its components provide insights about gradients of biodiversity. 4. Functional trait dispersion comports to reasonable criteria for a metric of functional diversity and can be decomposed in a variety of ways that facilitate understanding of patterns of variation. Other metrics of functional diversity neither integrate all three diversity components, nor can many be decomposed into variation within and among subgroups. Because functional trait dispersion measures properties of distance and the effective number of functionally distinct species, it can be used in conjunction with other biodiversity metrics that are based on species identity, abundance or phylogenetic relatedness to inform management and the preservation of biodiversity.","[Scheiner, Samuel M.] Natl Sci Fdn, Div Environm Biol, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Kosman, Evsey] Tel Aviv Univ, Inst Cereal Crops Improvement, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Presley, Steven J.; Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Presley, Steven J.; Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO); NSF - Division of Environmental Biology (DEB); Tel Aviv University; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Scheiner, SM (corresponding author), Natl Sci Fdn, Div Environm Biol, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230 USA.",sscheine@nsf.gov,"Presley, Steven/AAE-9189-2020; Kosman, Evsey/AAB-8207-2022; Scheiner, Samuel/A-4320-2009","Willig, Michael/0000-0001-6884-9957; Presley, Steven James/0000-0002-5987-0735; Kosman, Evsey/0000-0002-6121-063X; Scheiner, Samuel/0000-0003-1677-9752","U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-1050680, DEB-1239764]; Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of Connecticut; Colton Foundation at Tel Aviv University; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1546686] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of Connecticut; Colton Foundation at Tel Aviv University; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This work was facilitated by participation of S.J.P. and M.R.W., in a project entitled 'The Dimensions of Biodiversity Distributed Graduate Seminar', which was funded by a U.S. National Science Foundation grant to S.

Recently, network approaches have gained increasing popularity in studies of species interactions. These analyses provide important information about structural and functional organisation, as well as on the dynamics of species interactions. Common model systems for network studies include seed dispersal, pollination, and also parasite interactions. 2. Bat flies (Diptera: Streblidae, Nycteribiidae) are obligate blood-sucking ectoparasites of bats. Resource partitioning allows multiple fly species to co-occur on a single host individual, making them an ideal model system for network analyses. 3. Between 2013 and 2018 in Central Panama, 6528 bats from 53 species were examined for the presence of bat flies. Thereof, we collected a total of 6077 bat flies belonging to 52 species. 4. The resulting interaction network showed a significantly higher specificity (H-2' = 0.97) and modularity (Q = 0.78) than expected by chance, indicating a very high host specificity of the bat flies. To investigate parasite interactions in the context of host size, host abundance and roosting preferences, we pooled parasite identifications on genus level. The majority of our identified modules were associated with bats using persistent roosting structures. Neither host size nor host abundance appeared to affect module structure. Further, module structure appeared not to be host-phylogeny driven, instead modules were often composed of species known to share roosting structures. 5. Their high host-specificity could put bat flies at risk of extinction in changing environments.","[Hiller, Thomas; Braendel, Stefan D.; Tschapka, Marco] Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Hiller, Thomas; Braendel, Stefan D.; Page, Rachel A.; Tschapka, Marco] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Balboa, Panama; [Hiller, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Ecol Trop Agr Syst, Stuttgart, Germany; [Vollstadt, Maximilian G.

In this study, we identified those plant characteristics (identity, specific functional traits, or resource acquisition strategy) that were the best predictors of nitrification and denitrification processes. Ten plant populations representing eight species collected from three European grassland sites were chosen for their contrasting plant trait values and resource acquisition strategies. For each individual plant, leaf and root traits and the associated potential microbial activities (i.e., potential denitrification rate [DEA], maximal nitrification rate [NEA], and NH4+ affinity of the microbial community [NHScom]) were measured at two fertilization levels under controlled growth conditions. Plant traits were powerful predictors of plant-microbe interactions, but relevant plant traits differed in relation to the microbial function studied. Whereas denitrification was linked to the relative growth rate of plants, nitrification was strongly correlated to root trait characteristics (specific root length, root nitrogen concentration, and plant affinity for NH4+) linked to plant N cycling. The leaf economics spectrum (LES) that commonly serves as an indicator of resource acquisition strategies was not correlated to microbial activity. These results suggest that the LES alone is not a good predictor of microbial activity, whereas root traits appeared critical in understanding plant-microbe interactions.","[Cantarel, Amelie A.

This has generated strong selective pressure on the morphology and function of their digestive system. Given that in bats intestinal length and nominal surface-area are proportional to body mass, this trait importantly relates to explaining some of their digestive characteristics. We described the relationship between digestive traits and body mass of four species of bats of the family Vespertilionidae living in a montane ecosystem in central Mexico. We calculated food transit time, apparent dry matter digestibility, and defecation rate in feeding trials under captive conditions. We also: (1) built a model of the relationship between digestive traits and body mass to determine if this association was consistent within the members of the family Vespertilionidae, and (2) mapped these traits along the phylogeny to explore how digestive characteristics may have evolved. In our feeding trials, body mass was positively related to transit time and negatively related to apparent dry matter digestibility. The model predicted accurately the transit time in bats with body mass < 20 g. The phylogenetic approach suggested that over the evolutionary history of the family, transit time decreased as digestibility increased. Because of the results obtained here, it is likely that for most bats of the family Vespertilionidae, adaptations in digestive traits to process food have followed evolutionary changes in their body mass. We discuss these findings in a physiological and ecological context.","[Cabrera-Campos, Ivan] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Ctr Tlaxcala Biol Conducta, Ciencias Biol, Carretera Tlaxcala Puebla Km 1-5, Tlaxcala De Xicohtencatl 90062, Tlaxcala, Mexico; [Carballo-Morales, Jorge D.; Villalobos, Federico] Univ Nacl, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Lab Sistemat Genet & Evoluc LabSGE, Heredia, Costa Rica; [Saldana-Vazquez, Romeo A.] Xabier Gorostiaga SJ Univ Iberoamer Puebla, Inst Invest Medio Ambiente, Blvrd Nino Poblano 2901, Puebla 72810, Mexico; [Ayala-Berdon, Jorge] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, CONACYT, Carretera Tlaxcala Puebla Km 1-5, Tlaxcala De Xicohtencatl 90062, Tlaxcala, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Costa Rica,"Ayala-Berdon, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, CONACYT, Carretera Tlaxcala Puebla Km 1-5, Tlaxcala De Xicohtencatl 90062, Tlaxcala, Mexico.",jorgeayalaberdon@gmail.com,"Ayala-Berdon, Jorge/AAZ-4140-2021; Saldaña-Vázquez, Romeo/R-7154-2019; Carballo Morales, Jorge David/N-8514-2017","Carballo Morales, Jorge David/0000-0003-0089-0405; Villalobos Brenes, Federico/0000-0002-3387-8026",program CONACYT FOSEC CB2017-2018 [A1-S-39572],program CONACYT FOSEC CB2017-2018,This investigation was supported by the program CONACYT FOSEC CB2017-2018 (A1-S-39572) Granted to JAB.,,78,4,4,2,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0174-1578,1432-136X,,J COMP PHYSIOL B,J.

Under a functional perspective, studies have shown that environmental alterations can affect organisms' traits that are related to their performance, fitness and ecological functions. In the present study, we evaluated how the diversity and functional traits of two distinct bat guilds are affected by an elevational gradient in Atlantic forest, southeastern Brazil. Indices regarded to functional diversity and to dominant functional traits (Rao Quadratic Entropy - RaoQ and Community Weighted Mean - CWM) were calculated for both bat guilds: understory and open-space bat faunas. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were applied to verify the relation of each metric with elevation, and the presence of non-linear relationships were tested. Results showed that each guild of the bat community reacted differently to the elevational gradient, with statistically significant results of RaoQ for understory bats and of CWM for both guilds (for aspect ratio) or for only one bat guild (mass for understory bats and wing load for open-space bats). Our results illustrate how an environmental gradient can impose different selective pressures in each bat guild and how the distinct bat groups are affected by elevation. This is the first study considering functional aspects of open-space bats in the Neotropics.","[Silva Mancini, Matheus Camargo; Laurindo, Rafael de Souza; Mello, Rodrigo de Macedo; Gregorin, Renato] Univ Fed Lavras, Programa Posgrad Ecol Aplicada, Caixa Postal 3037, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Hintze, Frederico] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Lab Ciencia Aplicada Conservacao Biodiversidade, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Hintze, Frederico] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Recife, PE, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Mancini, MCS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Programa Posgrad Ecol Aplicada, Caixa Postal 3037, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",mthmancini@gmail.com,"Mancini, Matheus/C-9221-2019; Gregorin, Renato/D-8072-2016; Laurindo, Rafael/E-7042-2013; Simao Hintze Oliveira, Frederico/L-3270-2018; Laurindo, Rafael/S-2922-2017","Mancini, Matheus/0000-0002-5041-1639; Simao Hintze Oliveira, Frederico/0000-0003-4292-6525; Laurindo, Rafael/0000-0002-9326-3509",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) [001]; CNPq,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"We sincerely thank Erica Hasui, Rodrigo Fagundes Braga, Debora Guimaraes Apgaua, Nelson Curi, Luis Fernando Silva Magnago and Rafael Dudeque Zenni for valuable discussions that greatly improved this study and for their help with statistical analysis.

We investigated whether an animal's life history affects which of these two foraging strategies it is likely to use. Natterer's bats (Myotis nattereri) have slow life-history traits and we predicted they would be more likely to use associative learning. Common shrews (Sorex araneus) have fast life-history traits and we predicted that they would rely more heavily on routine-based search. Apart from their marked differences in life-history traits, these two mammals are similar in body size, brain weight, habitat, and diet. We assessed foraging strategy, associative learning ability, and retention time with a four-arm maze; one arm contained a food reward and was marked with four sensory stimuli. Bats and shrews differed significantly in their foraging strategies. Most bats learned to associate the sensory stimuli with the reward and remembered this association over time. Most shrews searched the maze using consistent decision-making rules, but did not learn or remember the association. We discuss these results in terms of life-history traits and other key differences between these species. Our results suggest a link between an animal's life-history strategy and its use of associative learning.","[Page, Rachel A.; von Merten, Sophie; Siemers, Bjoern M.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Sensory Ecol Grp, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany",Max Planck Society,,,"Page, Rachel/AAE-4816-2021; Merten, Sophie/U-6470-2018; Page, Rachel/GQQ-2818-2022","Page, Rachel/0000-0001-7072-0669; von Merten, Sophie/0000-0001-6010-1127",Max Planck Society; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship,Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"Many thanks to Leonie Baier, Daniela A.

Although conventional prey-predator dynamics focus on pairs of prey and predator species, the trait-based approach allows us to draw inferences at the scale of the entire assemblage. Here, we coupled measurable prey traits with their availability in the study area, to identify the vulnerability of a diverse moth assemblage to predation by the lesser false vampire bat (Megaderma spasma) Chiroptera: Megadermatidae, Linneaus 1758, a bat with flexible foraging strategies, in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India. We analysed the discarded prey remains from several roosts, collected over 3 years, for seasonal patterns in the diet and selective hunting. Through light-trapping, we collected moth specimens in different seasons and measured the morphological traits likely to affect their vulnerability to predation, such as body size and evasive flight capability. Our results showed that consumed moth prey diversity varies seasonally, with moths belonging to the Hepialidae family being preferred in the wet season. We found that the larger moth species with lower evasive capabilities are more vulnerable to predation. Sphingid and Hepialid moths, among the most abundant in the diet, have the lowest manoeuvrability and the maximum body size, respectively. By assessing vulnerability at the prey assemblage level, our study sets the stage for future research on moth-bat interactions from the diverse and less-explored Paleotropical communities. In addition, the study reiterates the usefulness of trait-based approaches to understanding prey-predator dynamics. In a diverse Paleotropical moth assemblage, from the Western Ghats of India, we found that the largest moths with the lowest evasive capabilities are the most vulnerable to predation by a flexibly foraging bat. Moths belonging to the Sphingidae family were the most abundant in the diet. They also were the lowest on manoeuvrability index. Hepialid moths, with the largest body size among all families, are preferred in the wet season. These moths only emerge during the wet season. image","[Dey, Pritha; Balakrishnan, Rohini] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, CV Raman Rd, Bangalore 560012, India; [Dey, Pritha] Univ Helsinki, Zool Unit, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Helsinki, Finland",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; University of Helsinki,"Dey, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, CV Raman Rd, Bangalore 560012, India.",dey.pritha126@gmail.com,"Balakrishnan, Rohini/Z-5881-2019; Dey, Pritha/AAZ-8778-2021","Dey, Pritha/0000-0003-3586-9235","DBT-IISc Partnership Program Phase II [FA/DBTO-18-0007.01]; Dr. D.S.

Here, we examined how the endo- and epiphytic phyllosphere microbiomes of mountains simultaneously respond to climate and leaf functional traits.Location: Temperate forests of Changbai Mountain Natural Reserve, China.Methods: We collected the leaves of dominant tree species along seven elevations from 800 to 1950. We investigated changes in species richness and Shannon diversity of endo- and epiphytic phyllosphere fungal and bacterial communities (using next-generation sequencing of ITS2 and 16S) along an 1150 m elevational gradient. We also examined the direct and indirect effects of climate (mean annual temperature; MAT) and 13 leaf morphological and chemical traits on the microbiome of the phyllosphere.Results: Phyllosphere microbiome declined monotonically with increasing elevation, contrasting with the hump-shaped biodiversity patterns that are commonly reported. We observed a steeper decline in epiphytic bacterial diversity than in endophytic bacteria, whereas conversely endophytic fungi diversity declined more dramatically with increasing elevation than epiphytic fungi. Host plant traits - those involved in resource uptake and leaf surface temperature - predominantly shaped the elevational patterns of endophytic phyllosphere microbiome, whereas MAT mostly increased the richness and Shannon diversity of epiphytic organisms. We also observed weak, but significant indirect effects suggesting that host plant traits are important biotic drivers mediating climate effects on endophytic phyllosphere microbiome. Also, no covariation between bacteria and fungi was observed (neither for endophytic nor for epiphytic organisms), supporting neutral associations between bacterial and fungal communities, irrespective of the elevation.Main Conclusions: Both direct and mediating effects of plant traits should be considered to better understand the drivers shaping the richness and Shannon diversity of endo- and epiphytic phyllosphere microbiomes, and more generally the plant-microbe associations. Our study also offers a trait-based attempt to disentangle the effects of biotic and abiotic filters in shaping endo- and epiphytic phyllosphere microbiome along an elevational gradient.","[Wang, Xing; Yuan, Zuoqiang; Lin, Fei; Mao, Zikun; Ye, Ji; Fang, Shuai; XugaoWang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CASKey Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Zuoqiang; Hao, Zhanqing] Northernwest Polytech Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, ShaanxiKey Lab Qinling Ecol Intelligent Monitoring, Xian, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, ForestEcol Res Grp, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Teng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, StateKey Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Fei; Mao, Zikun; Ye, Ji; Fang, Shuai; XugaoWang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst AppliedEcol, KeyLab Terr Ecosyst Carbon Neutral, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Le Bagousse-Pinguet, Yoann] Avignon Univ, Aix MarseilleUniv, CNRS, IRD,IMBE, Technopole Arbois Mediterranee Bat Villemin BP80, Aix En Provence, France; [Yuan, Zuoqiang] Northernwest Polytech Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Xian, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Hebei University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Soil Science, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Avignon Universite","Yuan, ZQ (corresponding author), Northernwest Polytech Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Xian, Peoples R China.",zqyuan@nwpu.edu.cn,"Le Bagousse-Pinguet, Yoann/I-2413-2016; Yang, Teng/ABW-3028-2022; Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014","Mao, Zikun/0000-0002-7035-9129; Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; Yang, Teng/0000-0002-8617-4698","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA23080301, XDB31030000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [32171581, 31670632]; Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi [22JHQ036]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: (XDA23080301& XDB31030000); National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: (32171581, 31670632); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi, Grant/Award Number: (22JHQ036); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",,100,5,5,39,109,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

In this study, we investigated the effects of different growing conditions on the morpho-physiological traits of Populus laurifolia and Ulmus pumila across five contrasting urban sites. The leaf area (LA), leaf length (LL), leaf width (LW), leaf biomass (LB), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, leaf water potential at predawn (Psi(pd)) and midday (Psi(md)), leaf performance index (PIabs), and phenotypic plasticity index (PPI) were compared across five contrasting urban sites. The soil chemical and physical properties were also compared between sites. There were significant differences in soil physicochemical characteristics between sites. We found significant effects of site on most of the morpho-physiological traits measured, except for Psi(md). The leaf chlorophyll concentration of P. laurifolia and U. pumila varied significantly between sites. The Psi(pd) was significantly different between years and sites. In U. pumila, the mean PPI for morphological traits (0.20) was lower than that for physiological traits (0.21). In conclusion, we revealed significant variations in the morpho-physiological traits of P. laurifolia and U. pumila across the five urban sites. Hence, long-term, large-scale studies are recommended to examine how diverse species respond to different urban growing conditions and to include other ecologically important plant traits for a better understanding of urban trees in a changing environment.","[Byambasuren, Otgonsaikhan; Byambadorj, Ser-Oddamba; Nyam-Osor, Tuguldur; Nyam-Osor, Batkhuu] Natl Univ Mongolia, Lab Forest Genet & Ecophysiol, Ulaanbaatar 14201, Mongolia; [Bat-Amgalan, Anujin] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Biol, Ulaanbaatar 14201, Mongolia; [Hernandez, Jonathan O.] Univ Philippines, Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, Dept Forest Biol Sci, Los Banos 4031, Philippines; [Nyam-Osor, Tuguldur] Mongolian Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Ulaanbaatar 15170, Mongolia",National University of Mongolia; National University of Mongolia; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of the Philippines Open University; Mongolian Academy of Sciences,"Nyam-Osor, B (corresponding author), Natl Univ Mongolia, Lab Forest Genet & Ecophysiol, Ulaanbaatar 14201, Mongolia.",saikhnaa80@gmail.com; anubat0424@gmail.com; seroddamba@gmail.com; johernandez2@up.edu.ph; nttuguldur0810@gmail.com; nbatkhuu@gmail.com,,"Batkhuu, Nyam-Osor/0000-0002-8683-8888; Ser-Oddamba, Byambadorj/0000-0002-0271-730X",Korea Forest Service,Korea Forest Service(Korea Forest Service),This work was financially supported by the Mongolia-Korea Joint Green Belt Plantation Project by the Korea Forest Service.,,66,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2223-7747,,,PLANTS-BASEL,Plants-Basel,OCT,2024,13,19,,,,,,,2709,10.3390/plants13192709,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants13192709,,,16,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,I9X1V,39409579,gold,,,2025-02-11,WOS:001333699900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most conservation-orientated studies of such landscapes focus on species diversity, whereas less attention is given to functional traits and their conservation. We examine the functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in three forest habitats (understorey, tree-fall gaps and riverbanks) and three deforested habitats (pasture, roadside vegetation and pasture riverbanks), each replicated in three human-dominated landscapes in southern Costa Rica. We focus on six categorical traits related to forest regeneration, reproduction and dispersal: pollination mechanism, dispersal mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size and seed size. We compared trait state richness and composition of each trait in forested and deforested habitats and how three pollination states (bat, bird and bee pollination) and three dispersal states (fur, bird and monkey dispersal) of conservation interest were distributed across these landscapes. Only one trait state was missing from forest, and none was missing from deforested habitats. Understorey and pasture were consistently trait state poor. Forested and deforested plots differed in trait state composition for all traits. Pasture riverbanks and road verges were compositionally similar to forest riverbanks and tree-fall gaps, for multiple traits. There were more compositional similarities between forested and deforested habitat types when abundance of individuals with a trait state was used as the basis for similarity measures than when the number of species with each trait state was used. Bat-, bird- and bee-pollinated plants and plants with bird- and monkey-dispersed fruits were most common in forest and pasture riverbanks whereas species with fur-dispersed seeds were more common in all deforested habitats. Functional diversity patterns were inconsistent across habitat types and locations but overall functional similarity was high between forested and deforested communities. Patterns of functional diversity were far more variable between habitats and landscapes than the consistent patterns found previously for species diversity.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",mayfield@msi.ucsb.edu,"Mayfield, Margaret/B-7386-2012; Ackerly, David/A-1247-2009","Mayfield, Margaret/0000-0002-5101-6542; Ackerly, David/0000-0002-1847-7398",,,,,68,62,78,3,96,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

To determine the effect of urbanization on the diversity of bat communities in urban and suburban environments, we analyzed the alpha and beta taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversities at four sites along urbanization gradients surrounding a rapidly expanding city (Oaxaca City) in southern Mexico. We recorded bats using conventional techniques such as mist nets and acoustic monitoring. We calculated the diversity of bats in four sites with different urbanization conditions: urban (1), suburban (1), and rural (2). To assess the degree of total differentiation and components of bat turnover and nestedness between sites, we calculated the beta taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversities. A total of 33 bat species were recorded. The highest taxonomic and functional diversity was observed in the Center of Oaxaca (the site with the highest level of urbanization). In contrast, the highest phylogenetic diversity was found in the West (the site with the lowest level of urbanization). The total beta taxonomic diversity was higher than the functional and phylogenetic diversity. Regarding the contributions of turnover and nestedness, turnover made a more significant contribution than nestedness to the taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity. In contrast, functional nestedness contributed more to the functional beta diversity than turnover. Tadarida brasiliensis, Desmodus rotundus, Sturnira hondurensis, and S. parvidens were recorded in all three urbanization conditions. In the most urbanized site, four Myotis species were recorded: M. fortidens, M. keaysi, M. thysanodes, and M. velifer. We suggest that the analysis of different dimensions of diversity is essential and should be considered to strengthen conservation strategies; moreover, we suggest the preservation of native vegetation mosaics and water bodies within the city to maintain bat diversity.","[Briones-Salas, Miguel; Medina-Cruz, Gabriela E.; Martin-Regalado, Cintia Natalia] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Invest Desarrollo Integral, Unidad Oaxaca, Xoxocotlan 71230, Oaxaca, Mexico; [Martin-Regalado, Cintia Natalia] Consejo Nacl Humanidades Ciencia & Tecnol, Mexico City 03940, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico,"Martin-Regalado, CN (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Invest Desarrollo Integral, Unidad Oaxaca, Xoxocotlan 71230, Oaxaca, Mexico.;Martin-Regalado, CN (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Humanidades Ciencia & Tecnol, Mexico City 03940, Mexico.",mbriones@ipn.mx; gmedinac1700@alumno.ipn.mx; nataliamartinregalado@gmail.com,"Salas, Miguel/AAP-2977-2020","Briones-Salas, Miguel/0000-0003-1413-9946",National Polytechnic Institute [SIP: 20230797],National Polytechnic Institute,This study was partially supported by SIP: 20230797 of the National Polytechnic Institute.,,79,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,SEP,2024,16,9,,,,,,,527,10.3390/d16090527,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d16090527,,,16,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,H5R0X,,gold,,,2025-02-11,WOS:001324001000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we sought to understand the phenotypic evolution of key traits in Rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats) using phylogenetic comparative methods. We aimed to test the phylogenetic signals of traits, and evaluated the best-fit evolutionary models given the data for each trait considering different traits may evolve under different models (i.e., Brownian Motion [BM], Ornstein-Uhlenbeck [OU], and Early Burst [EB]) and reconstruct ancestral character states. We examined how phenotypic characters are associated with echolocation calls and minimum detectable prey size. We measured 34 traits of 10 Asian rhinolophids species (187 individuals). We found that the majority of traits showed a high phylogenetic signal based on Blomberg ' s K and Pagel ' s lambda, but each trait may evolve under different evolutionary models. Sella traits were shown to evolve under stabilizing selection based on OU models, indicating sella traits have the tendency to move forward along the branches toward some medial value in equilibrium. Our findings highlight the importance of sella characters in association with echolocation call emissions in Rhinolophidae, as calls are important for spatial cognition and also influence dietary preferences. Minimum detectable prey size in Rhinolophidae was associated with call frequency, bandwidth, call duration, wingspan, and wing surface area. Ultimately, understanding trait evolution requires sensitivity due to the differential selective pressures which may apply to different characteristics.","[Chornelia, Ada] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Landscape Ecol Grp, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden XTBG, Menglun 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Chornelia, Ada] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Int Coll, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hughes, Alice C.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Hong Kong","Hughes, AC (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ach_conservation2@hotmail.com,"; hughes, Alice/HCH-3838-2022","Chornelia, Ada/0000-0002-8541-5947; hughes, Alice/0000-0002-4899-3158",Chinese National Natural Science Foundation [U1602265]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20050202]; Chinese Academy of Sciences Southeast Asia Biodiversity Research Center fund [Y4ZK111B01],Chinese National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Chinese Academy of Sciences Southeast Asia Biodiversity Research Center fund,"We thank many researchers who made this study possible through their detailed studies of bats and uploading their sequences to GenBank, and publicly sharing the published data used in this study.

In this study, we reviewed the status of bat diversity in the arid parts of southern Africa, with the aim of setting up a baseline for future work. In particular, we described species richness patterns across four arid zones within the region (Namib Desert, Kalahari, Nama Karoo and Succulent Karoo), exploring abiotic gradients and local landscape structure. Additionally, we examined bat functional groups in this region and compared them with those of three other arid regions of the world to identify potential similarities and differences. The southern African arid region hosted 17 bat species, representing eight families, of which three are endemic to the region (Rhinolophus denti, Laephotis namibensis and Cistugo seabrae) and one is vagrant (the fruit bat Eidolon helvum). Species richness varied spatially within this arid region, being highest in the drier but topographically heterogeneous Namib Desert, probably as a result of roost availability. With regards to functional groups, the southern African arid region had few bat species adapted to foraging in open spaces, particularly when compared with the neighbouring savannahs. Drawing from this study, we suggest that: a) despite species richness decreasing with increasing aridity at the sub-continental scale, at a more local scale landscape features (e.g. habitat structure) might be more relevant than aridity in determining bat species richness; and b) an unknown factor, possibly patterns of temperature limiting the availability of insects flying high above the ground, restricted the diversity of the open air foragers throughout the region. We highlight additional areas of research worth investigation.","[Monadjem, Ara] Univ Swaziland, Dept Biol Sci, Private Bag 4, Kwaluseni, Eswatini; [Monadjem, Ara] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Private Bag 20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa; [Conenna, Irene] Univ Helsinki, Global Change & Conservat, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Taylor, Peter J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Taylor, Peter J.] Univ Venda, South African Res Chair Biodivers Value & Change, P Bag X5050, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa; [Taylor, Peter J.; Schoeman, M.

Soils used for the experimental setup were collected from wet grasslands of the Seine floodplain to represent contrasting organic matter content and texture. Plants were submitted to no, medium and total waterlogging levels. The no waterlogging level, used as a control, was also performed to estimate the topsoil effects on H. lanatus growth. Morphological and functional response traits (e.g. shoot height, biomass, specific leaf area, nitrogen and carbon contents) were measured on harvested plants at the beginning of the experiment and after 3, 7, 30, and 90 days of waterlogging. As expected, a topsoil effect was immediately recorded on plant development traits (i.e. biomass, number of ramets, and height) and carbon content. On three soils of the four tested, H. lanatus better developed on medium waterlogging level which represents the intermediate level of constraints of the waterlogging gradient tested. Finally, the study demonstrates that the effect of medium waterlogging applied on plants varied among different topsoils. Interestingly, the effect of medium waterlogging was the most beneficial for topsoil conditions where plant initial growth was the lowest. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

These range expansions should be monitored thoroughly because they may alter local bat communities. The steppe whiskered bat Myotis davidii, for instance, has probably expanded its range from Central Asia to Eastern Europe. However, monitoring the range expansion of M. davidii is challenging because M. davidii and its sister species M. mystacinus are morphologically similar. Here, we investigated whether M. davidii occurs in Austria, which would extend its known range to the North-West. To facilitate the morphological identification of M. davidii and enable efficient monitoring approaches, we propose a morphometric approach. We analysed morphometric data of 102 M. mystacinus and 78 M. davidii. We applied sex-specific linear discriminant analyses to investigate whether a combination of hindfoot length, tibia length and forearm length could be used to distinguish M. davidii from M. mystacinus. The discriminant functions correctly identified 88 % of females and 82 % of males of the genetically verified individuals. Combined with dental characteristics, bat workers can reliably identify M. davidii based on morphometric traits. To investigate whether M. davidii had been previously found in Austria, we applied the discriminant functions to data of 61 Austrian M. mystacinus specimens preserved in the Natural History Museum Vienna. Since we did not find M. davidii specimens in the museum's collection - the most comprehensive of Austrian mammal collection - we presume that M. davidii is a relatively new element of the Austrian fauna. This indicates that M. davidii has expanded its range over the last decades. The discriminant functions will facilitate monitoring of this potential range expansion.","[Milchram, Markus] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Integrat Biol & Biodivers Res, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Milchram, Markus; Mixanig, Harald; Wieser, Daniela; Reiter, Guido] Austrian Coordinat Ctr Bat Conservat & Res KFFO, Fritz Stork Str 13, A-4060 Leonding, Austria; [Dietz, Christian] Biolog Gutachten Dietz, Balinger Str 15, D-72401 Haigerloch, Germany; [Mayer, Frieder; Gurke, Marie] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodiversitatsforsch, Museum Naturkunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Krainer, Klaus; Mixanig, Harald; Wieser, Daniela] Arge NATURSCHUTZ, Gasometergasse 10, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria",BOKU University; Leibniz Institut fur Evolutions und Biodiversitatsforschung,"Milchram, M (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Integrat Biol & Biodivers Res, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.;Milchram, M (corresponding author), Austrian Coordinat Ctr Bat Conservat & Res KFFO, Fritz Stork Str 13, A-4060 Leonding, Austria.",markus.milchram@boku.ac.at,"Milchram, Markus/JFJ-0744-2023; Gurke, Marie/GYR-0481-2022","Milchram, Markus/0000-0001-5181-5830",,,,,42,1,1,0,2,ASSOC TERIOLOGICA ITALIANA,ROMA,"C/O GIOVANNI AMORI, CNR-ISE VIALE DELL UNIVERSITA 23, ROMA, I-00185, ITALY",0394-1914,1825-5272,,HYSTRIX,Hystrix,,2023,34,1,,,,,19,23,,10.4404/hystrix-00564-2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.4404/hystrix-00564-2022,,,5,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,FO1G7,,,,,2025-02-11,WOS:001146681900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet relatively few mechanistic studies have focused on this longevity. On average, species of Chiroptera live three times longer than predicted by their body size. In addition, bats have other life history traits that are characteristic of large, long-lived mammals such as few and large offspring and slow growth rates. Bats fit the evolutionary theory of ageing, as their extended longevity is predicted by their ability to escape extrinsic mortality through light and, in some species, hibernation. They also show tradeoffs between longevity and reproduction, as predicted by the disposable soma theory of ageing. From a physiological perspective, bat longevity reportedly correlates with replicative longevity, low brain calpain activity, and reduced reactive oxygen species production. As long-lived and physiologically interesting organisms, bats may prove to be an informative model system for ageing research.","Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",University of Idaho,"Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, POB 443051, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",anja.brunet@stanfordalumni.org,,,NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG022873] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,99,126,160,2,85,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-5729,1573-6768,,BIOGERONTOLOGY,Biogerontology,AUG,2004,5,4,,,,,211,222,,10.1023/B:BGEN.0000038022.65024.d8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:BGEN.0000038022.65024.d8,,,12,Geriatrics & Gerontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geriatrics & Gerontology,846RE,15314271,,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000223332700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesized that urbanization acts as a filter on species traits and, therefore, that urban passerines share biological traits explaining their capacity to tolerate urban constraints. We investigated 18 biological traits of passerines related to their general biology, distribution, breeding, and morphometry. In a regional analysis conducted on passerine data from one Swiss and 11 French cities (regional analysis), we identified urban adapters (tolerant species) and urban avoiders (intolerant species), and compared their traits. In a local analysis conducted on passerine data of 13 woodlands located along a short rural-urban gradient, we identified groups of species associated with particular vegetation structures within or particular landscape structures around woodlands. We associated each of these species groups with a tolerance level to urbanization and compared their traits. Regional analysis revealed that urban adapters prefer forest environments, are sedentary, omnivorous, widely distributed, high-nesters with large wingspans. Urban avoiders seem to allocate more energy to reproduction than do urban adapters, to the detriment of adaptation to new environments such as urban areas. Local analysis did not reveal any link between traits and species tolerance levels. At large spatial scales, urbanization seems therefore to act as a filter on species traits. However, the urban constraints that filter species at such large scales do not seem to be the same ones that determine species distribution at local scales. Analyses of traits are powerful tools to understanding regional community composition between urban and rural areas.","[Croci, Solene; Clergeau, Philippe] INRA SCRIBE, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Croci, Solene; Butet, Alain] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, ECOBIO, CAREN,UMR 6553, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Clergeau, Philippe] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Ecol & Gest Biodivers, UMR 5173, F-75005 Paris, France",INRAE; Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN),"Croci, S (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, UMR Ecol Fluvial Hydrosyst Bat Darwin C 5023, 43 Blvd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",solene.croci@gmail.com,,,,,,,70,291,345,9,174,COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0010-5422,,,CONDOR,Condor,MAY,2008,110,2,,,,,223,240,,10.1525/cond.2008.8409,http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/cond.2008.8409,,,18,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,343KJ,,Bronze,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000258851900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The most critical adaptive changes resulting from the domestication process involved the spikelet structure: non-shedding seeds with reduced bracts and bristles and long involucral pedicel. Major differences also concerned characters describing the plant architecture, phenology and spike sizes. Many morphological differences could be attributed to the effect of a small number of loci with relatively large effects. These loci are mainly concentrated on four linkage groups (2, 5, 6 and 7). The loss of shedding ability, due to the absence of a functional abscission layer, is controlled by a single locus on linkage group 6 (al6). Genetic control of the other spikelet traits involved factors with large effects which are located in the region of linkage group 6 close to al6 and to an esterase gene, Esterase-E. Moreover, QTLs with large effects on plant and spike morphology traits such as plant height, number of spikes and weight of the spike were also mapped on linkage groups 6 and 7. This strong linkage of factors in the domestication syndrome may be involved in the maintenance of the phenotypic identity of wild and cultivated populations in sympatry. This result also brings new arguments in the understanding of the domestication process of this allogamous crop.","Univ Paris 11, Lab Evolut & Systemat, URA 2154, CNRS, F-91405 Orsay, France; John Innes Ctr, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); John Innes Center,"Univ Paris 11, Lab Evolut & Systemat, URA 2154, CNRS, Bat 362, F-91405 Orsay, France.",Valerie.Poncet@esv.u-psud.fr,"Poncet, Valérie/A-9038-2011; Devos, Katrien/B-1380-2014","Poncet, Valerie/0000-0002-1099-2846",,,,,58,85,94,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0040-5752,1432-2242,,THEOR APPL GENET,Theor.

Here we test predictions from Charnov's model using both phylogenetic comparative techniques and cross-species analyses in bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera). We find some support for Charnov's life-history model in terms of the predicted values for the interrelationships of the length of the juvenile period and adult mortality, and his predicted invariants are also well supported. However, annual fecundity is not significantly correlated with body size as predicted. Overall, the evidence presented here does not offer convincing support for the applicability of Charnov's model to bats. We propose that an explanation for these results is that bats decouple the age at which sexual maturity is reached from the age at which adult size is reached, because of the constraints of flight. This violates one of the assumptions not only of Charnov's model, but also of the more general model of Kozlowski and Weiner.","Univ Surrey Roehampton, Sch Life Sci, London SW15 3SN, England",Roehampton University; University of Surrey,"Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Gilmer Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",kate.jones@virginia.edu,"Jones, Kate/Y-3317-2019; Jones, Kate/G-4768-2010","Jones, Kate/0000-0001-5231-3293; MacLarnon, Ann/0000-0003-2722-4998",,,,,60,38,41,2,24,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

Hymenaea is a monophyletic legume genus widely recognized to being bat-pollinated, with nocturnal anthesis and copious nectar. The most of species has short-paniculate inflorescences, white and robust flowers, congruent with a bat-pollination syndrome. However, other Hymenaea species show a different floral pattern (e.g., long-paniculate inflorescences and smaller flowers) which we report here as being bird pollinated. We examined the floral traits and visitors of Hymenaea oblongifolia var. latifolia and identified evolutionary shifts in floral traits associated with potential pollinators of Hymenaea species. Floral traits of H. oblongifolia var. latifolia differ from those expected for bat-pollinated flowers in species of sect. Hymenaea, and we observed hummingbirds collecting nectar legitimately. Our phylogenetic analysis did not support the monophyly of the taxonomic sections and suggests that bat pollination is ancestral in Hymenaea, with bird pollination evolving later. The transition coupling with shifts in the timing of anthesis and other floral traits. Pollinator-mediated evolutionary divergence hypothesis partially explains the Hymenaea diversification in the Neotropics. It is congruent with those species shifting from traits linked traditionally to bat pollination to hummingbird pollination.","[Souza, Isys M.; Hughes, Frederic M.; Funch, Ligia S.; De Queiroz, Luciano P.] Univ Estadual Feira de Santana, Programa Posgrad Bot, Av Transnordestina S-N, BR-44036900 Feira De Santana, BA, Brazil; [Hughes, Frederic M.] Inst Nacl Mata Atlantica INMA, Av Jose Ruschi 4, BR-29650000 Santa Teresa, ES, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana,"Souza, IM (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Feira de Santana, Programa Posgrad Bot, Av Transnordestina S-N, BR-44036900 Feira De Santana, BA, Brazil.",isys.souza@gmail.com,"Hughes, Frederic/M-8830-2018; Funch, Ligia/I-1404-2012; de Queiroz, Luciano Paganucci/I-1378-2012","de Queiroz, Luciano Paganucci/0000-0001-7436-0939; Mascarenhas Souza, Isys/0000-0002-7357-4991","Programa de Pesquisa em Biodiversidade do Semiarido (PPBIO); Sistema Nacional de Pesquisa em Biodiversidade (SISBIOTA) [CNPq 563084/2010-3, FAPESB PES0053/2011]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES) [001]; CAPES grant; CNPq-Pq1A grant; [CNPq-302381/2020-1]",Programa de Pesquisa em Biodiversidade do Semiarido (PPBIO); Sistema Nacional de Pesquisa em Biodiversidade (SISBIOTA); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CAPES grant(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq-Pq1A grant;,"This paper is part of the PhD Thesis of IMS in the Pos-Graduate Program in Botany of the Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

However, the definition of convergence is elusive and contradictory in the literature. Is convergence the independent evolution of either the same trait or similar traits with the same function? A review of the concept of convergence in developmental biology and phylogenetic systematics may shed new light in studies of pollination syndromes.center dot Scope The aims of this article are (1) to explore the notion of convergence and other concepts (analogy, homoplasy and parallelism) within the theory and practice of developmental evolution and phylogenetic systematics; (2) to modify the definitions of syndromes in order to embrace the concepts of analogy and convergence; (3) to revisit the bat pollination syndrome in the context of angiosperm phylogeny, with focus on the showy 'petaloid' organs associated with the syndrome; (4) to revisit the genetic-developmental basis of flower colour; (5) to raise evolutionary hypotheses of floral evolution associated with the bat pollination syndrome; and (6) to highlight some of the current frontiers of research on the origin and evolution of flowers and its impact on pollination syndrome studies in the 21st century.center dot Conclusions The inclusion of the concepts of analogy and convergence within the concept of syndromes will constitute a new agenda of inquiry that integrates floral biology, phylogenetic systematics and developmental biology. Phyllostomid and pteropodid bat pollination syndrome traits in eudicots and monocots represent cases of analogous and convergent evolution. Pollination syndromes are a multivariate concept intrinsically related to the understanding of flower organogenesis and evolution. The formulation of hypotheses of pollination syndromes must consider the phylogenetic levels of universality for both plant and animal taxa, flower development, genetics, homology and evolution, and a clear definition of evolutionary concepts, including analogy, convergence, homoplasy and parallelism.","[Assis, Leandro C.

However, information on how teeth perform under natural conditions is rare, which limits the understanding of how dental morphology influences dietary ecology and niche partitioning within animal communities. Free-tailed bats (Chiroptera: Molossidae) are a diverse clade of aerial insectivorous mammals that exhibit an outstanding variation in size and craniodental traits, which have been directly related to ecological segregation among sympatric species. We investigate the mechanisms that allow functional dietary specialization and trophic segregation among sympatric free-tailed bat species inhabiting a Neotropical forest. To do so, we coupled data on 3D dental topographic metrics, head and skull dimensions, field-collected feeding performance and dietary hardness measurements. We found that evolved differences in molar topography and skull size vary in tandem with the mechanical demands of prey items naturally consumed by sympatric molossid species. This may be explained by feeding performance capabilities resulting from both molar shape and the overall size of the feeding apparatus, which seem to allow efficient processing of prey items with specific mechanical properties. For instance, smaller bats with higher molar topographic values (sharper, more complex molars) and more gracile heads mainly feed on softer insects, whereas bigger bats with lower molar topographic values (blunter, less complex molars) and more robust heads mostly feed on tougher insects. Species with a broader range of sizes, craniodental morphologies and insect hardness are also present in the community. These results illustrate how the morphology and size of feeding structures, and how they perform, may facilitate trophic segregation among sympatric insectivorous bats. Similar mechanisms may help structure other communities of insectivorous mammals, therefore the approaches presented here could be used to generate a better understanding of the ecomorphological traits and processes that underlie their diversity.

Goal: We aimed to compare temporal variability in taxonomic and trait compositions of nearly natural rivers in two climatic regions with varying flow regimes to address the effects of future climate changes on aquatic biodiversity in reference conditions. Methods: We analysed taxonomic and biological trait compositions using the Foucard multivariate method to compare within-site temporal variability levels and the evolution of within-date spatial variability patterns. In addition, we assessed the effects of temporal variability levels on taxonomic and functional diversity and on community specialization. Results: Our results reveal (i) highly fluctuating environments of the Mediterranean region, particularly in intermittent rivers, which lead to higher levels of temporal variability in both taxonomic and trait compositions of benthic invertebrate assemblages, with marked synchrony in Mediterranean streams linked to contrasting flow characteristics; (ii) higher degrees of taxonomic richness associated with higher levels of functional diversity in Mediterranean rivers relative to temperate rivers, (iii) higher temporal stability for functional diversity and trait compositions of benthic invertebrate assemblages than for taxonomic richness and compositions; and (iv) a recovery of all diversity metrics following drying events in intermittent sites. Conclusion: This study offers insight into a rarely addressed question concerning the temporal variability of trait compositions in benthic invertebrate assemblages among rivers differing in terms of flow regimes. It suggests that temperate rivers will experience higher levels of temporal variability in terms of taxonomic and trait compositions under future climatic change scenarios, even in sites that will remain perennial, resulting in higher levels of taxonomic and functional diversity. This lack of temporal stability in least-disturbed situations should be taken into account when developing bioassessment tools based on reference conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Bats are a species-rich, globally distributed group of organisms that are thought to be particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change because of their high surface-to-volume ratios and low reproductive rates. We systematically reviewed the literature on bat responses to climate change to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps and biases and highlight future research needs. We found that studies are geographically biased towards Europe, North America and Australia, and temperate and Mediterranean biomes, thus missing a substantial proportion of bat diversity and thermal responses. Less than half of the published studies provide concrete evidence for bat responses to climate change. For over a third of studied bat species, response evidence is only based on predictive species distribution models. Consequently, the most frequently reported responses involve range shifts (57% of species) and changes in patterns of species diversity (26%). Bats showed a variety of responses, including both positive (e.g. range expansion and population increase) and negative responses (range contraction and population decrease), although responses to extreme events were always negative or neutral. Spatial responses varied in their outcome and across families, with almost all taxonomic groups featuring both range expansions and contractions, while demographic responses were strongly biased towards negative outcomes, particularly among Pteropodidae and Molossidae. The commonly used correlative modelling approaches can be applied to many species, but do not provide mechanistic insight into behavioural, physiological, phenological or genetic responses. There was a paucity of experimental studies (26%), and only a small proportion of the 396 bat species covered in the examined studies were studied using long-term and/or experimental approaches (11%), even though they are more informative about the effects of climate change. We emphasise the need for more empirical studies to unravel the multifaceted nature of bats' responses to climate change and the need for standardised study designs that will enable synthesis and meta-analysis of the literature. Finally, we stress the importance of overcoming geographic and taxonomic disparities through strengthening research capacity in the Global South to provide a more comprehensive view of terrestrial biodiversity responses to climate change.","[Festa, Francesca] Ist Zooprofilatt Sperimentale Venezia, Lab Emerging Viral Zoonoses, Res & Innovat Dept, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy;

Then, we evaluated the correlation between bat activity and insect resources and assessed dietary niche similarity and niche breadth among species and factors that influence prey consumption in bats. Additionally, we explored the functional response between these predators and their prey, understanding how bat feeding behavior adapts to the availability of different pest species. We proved that bats provide vital pest consumption services in agricultural ecosystems and their diet included arthropods from 23 orders and 200 families. Moreover, bats responded to the availability of insects. For example, a higher abundance of insects, especially Lepidoptera, and a higher insect diversity led to an increase in the duration of bat activity. In areas with more abundant insects, the number of bat passes also increased. Our results suggested that dietary niche differentiation promotes the coexistence of different bat species and increases the ability of bats to consume insect prey and agricultural pests. Our findings provide greater insights into the role of bats that prey on agricultural pests and highlight the importance of combining bat conservation with integrated pest management.Abstract Insectivorous bats are generalist predators and can flexibly respond to fluctuations in the distribution and abundance of insect prey. To better understand the effects of bats on arthropod pests, the types of pests eaten by bats and the response of bats to insect prey need to be determined. In this study, we performed DNA metabarcoding to examine prey composition and pest diversity in the diets of four insectivorous species of bats (Hipposideros armiger, Taphozous melanopogon, Aselliscus stoliczkanus, and Miniopterus fuliginosus). We evaluated the correlation between bat activity and insect resources and assessed dietary niche similarity and niche breadth among species and factors that influence prey consumption in bats. We found that the diets of these bats included arthropods from 23 orders and 200 families, dominated by Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera. The proportion of agricultural pests in the diet of each of the four species of bats exceeded 40% and comprised 713 agricultural pests, including those that caused severe economic losses. Bats responded to the availability of insects. For example, a higher abundance of insects, especially Lepidoptera, and a higher insect diversity led to an increase in the duration of bat activity. In areas with more abundant insects, the number of bat passes also increased. The dietary composition, diversity, and niches differed among species and were particularly significant between H. armiger and T. melanopogon; the dietary niche width was the greatest in A. stoliczkanus and the narrowest in H. armiger. The diet of bats was correlated with their morphological and echolocation traits. Larger bats preyed more on insects in the order Coleoptera, whereas the proportion of bats consuming insects in the order Lepidoptera increased as the body size decreased. Bats that emitted echolocation calls with a high peak frequency and duration preyed more on insects in the order Mantodea. Our results suggest that dietary niche differentiation promotes the coexistence of different bat species and increases the ability of bats to consume insect prey and agricultural pests. Our findings provide greater insights into the role of bats that prey on agricultural pests and highlight the importance of combining bat conservation with integrated pest management.","[Zhu, Dan; Liu, Yingying; Gong, Lixin; Si, Man; Wang, Qiuya; Feng, Jiang; Jiang, Tinglei] Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Prov Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Utili, 2555 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dan; Liu, Yingying; Gong, Lixin; Si, Man; Wang, Qiuya; Feng, Jiang; Jiang, Tinglei] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Educ Minist, 2555 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qiuya; Feng, Jiang] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, 2888 Xincheng St, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China; Northeast Normal University - China; Jilin Agricultural University,"Feng, J; Jiang, TL (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Prov Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Utili, 2555 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China.;Feng, J; Jiang, TL (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Educ Minist, 2555 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China.;Feng, J (corresponding author), Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, 2888 Xincheng St, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China.",zhud969@nenu.edu.cn; liuyy777@nenu.edu.cn; gonglx216@nenu.edu.cn; sim663@nenu.edu.cn; wangqiuya123@outlook.com; fengj@nenu.edu.cn; jiangtl730@nenu.edu.cn,"Jiang, Tinglei/GQQ-9485-2022","jiang, tinglei/0000-0003-3858-9458",National Natural Science Foundation of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We are grateful to Chengxi Yang and Lin Gan for their help during the sample collection.

To assess interactions, we consider distinct traits that are probably to be triggered by niche shape and evolutionary processes. We present data on the trophic niche differentiation between two sympatric European trawling bat species, Myotis dasycneme and Myotis daubentonii, incorporating a wide spectrum of methodological approaches. We measure morphological traits involved in foraging and prey handling performance including bite force, weightlifting capacity and wing morphology. We then measure resulting prey consumption using both morphological and molecular diet analyses. These species closely resemble each other in morphological traits, however, subtle but significant differences were apparent in bite force and lift capacity, which are related to differences in basic body and head size. Both morphological and molecular diet analyses show strong niche overlap. We detected subtle differences in less frequent prey items, as well as differences in the exploitation of terrestrial and aquatic-based prey groups. Myotis dasycneme feeds more on aquatic prey, like Chironomidae and their pupal stages, or on the aquatic moth Acentria ephemerella. Myotis daubentonii feeds more on terrestrial prey, like Brachycera, or Coleoptera. This suggests that these bats use different microhabitats within the habitat where they co-occur.","[Krueger, F.; Sommer, R.

Furthermore, these differences can be linked to sensory, morphological and behavioural capabilities of the figs' primary dispersers. One group of figs attracts primarily bats; the other group is visited mainly by birds. Whereas fruits of 'bat' figs span a wide range of size classes, ripen synchronously and remain green(ish) when ripe, all fruits of 'bird' figs have small fruit which ripen asynchronously and turn red when ripe. Among 'bat' figs, fruit size is correlated with body size of the bats that prefer them. Based on the consistent differences between 'bat' and 'bird' fig fruits in Panama we expect similar patterns in Old World figs. Furthermore, since fig-eating bats of the Old World differ in morphology, behaviour and sensory capabilities from fig-eating bats of the New World we speculate that these differences should be reflected in differences in fruit characteristics of Old and New World 'bat' figs. Personal observations and literature reports of Old World bats and figs are consistent with our predictions.","SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST, BALBOA, PANAMA; NATL MUSEUM NAT HIST, DIV MAMMALS, MRC, NHB 108, WASHINGTON, DC 20560 USA",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History,"Kalko, EKV (corresponding author), UNIV TUBINGEN, MORGENSTELLE 28, D-72076 TUBINGEN, GERMANY.",,,,,,,,110,172,206,1,44,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Knowledge of the mechanisms driving differential sensitivity can inform conservation strategies but is generally lacking for species-rich taxa in the tropics. The diverse bat fauna of Southeast Asia is threatened by rapid loss of forest and expanding agricultural activities, but the associations between species, traits, vulnerability to agriculture, and the underlying drivers have yet to be elucidated. We studied the responses of speciose insectivorous bat assemblages to robusta coffee cultivation in Sumatra, Indonesia. We compared abundance, species richness, and assemblage structures of bats between forests and coffee farms based on trapping data and evaluated the influence of vegetation complexity on assemblage composition and species-level reactions. Bat abundance and species richness were significantly lower in coffee farms than in forests. Bat assemblage structure differed between land uses, and the overall variation can be largely explained by vegetation simplification. Species sensitive to coffee agriculture were associated with more complex vegetation structure, whereas tolerant species were associated with simpler vegetation structure. Sensitive and tolerant species differed in the type, frequency, and bandwidth of echolocation calls and roost use. Species sensitive to coffee use broadband and high-pitched frequency-modulated calls, which are efficient at detecting insects in complex vegetation, and roost in plant structures that may be lost as vegetation is simplified. In contrast, tolerant species used lower pitched constant-frequency calls and roost in caves. We advocate for greater use of trait analyses in studies seeking to clarify the influence of agriculture on diverse tropical bat faunas. in Indonesian is available with online material.","[Huang, Joe Chun-Chia; Kingston, Tigga] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 43131, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Rustiati, Elly Lestari] Univ Lampung, Dept Biol, Coll Math & Nat Sci, Lampung, Indonesia; [Nusalawo, Meyner] Wildlife Conservat Soc Indonesia Program, Kota Bogor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Universitas Lampung,"Huang, JCC (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 43131, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",ecojoe.huang@gmail.com,"Huang, Joe/AAG-9365-2019","Huang, Joe Chun-Chia/0000-0001-5081-5900; Kingston, Tigga/0000-0003-3552-5352",Bat Conservation International; American Society of Mammalogists; National Science Foundation [1051363]; Rufford Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1051363] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Bat Conservation International; American Society of Mammalogists; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Rufford Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Bat Conservation International; American Society of Mammalogists; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1051363; Rufford Foundation",,78,14,17,3,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0006-3606,1744-7429,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,SEP,2019,51,5,,,,,757,768,,10.1111/btp.12694,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.12694,,SEP 2019,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JA4RM,,Bronze,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000484746900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This global analysis on 5302 vertebrate and invertebrate species finds evidence of 4 trait syndromes in urban animal assemblages, modulated by spatial and geographic factors. Cities can host significant biological diversity. Yet, urbanisation leads to the loss of habitats, species, and functional groups. Understanding how multiple taxa respond to urbanisation globally is essential to promote and conserve biodiversity in cities. Using a dataset encompassing six terrestrial faunal taxa (amphibians, bats, bees, birds, carabid beetles and reptiles) across 379 cities on 6 continents, we show that urbanisation produces taxon-specific changes in trait composition, with traits related to reproductive strategy showing the strongest response. Our findings suggest that urbanisation results in four trait syndromes (mobile generalists, site specialists, central place foragers, and mobile specialists), with resources associated with reproduction and diet likely driving patterns in traits associated with mobility and body size. Functional diversity measures showed varied responses, leading to shifts in trait space likely driven by critical resource distribution and abundance, and taxon-specific trait syndromes. Maximising opportunities to support taxa with different urban trait syndromes should be pivotal in conservation and management programmes within and among cities. This will reduce the likelihood of biotic homogenisation and helps ensure that urban environments have the capacity to respond to future challenges. These actions are critical to reframe the role of cities in global biodiversity loss.","[Hahs, Amy K.; Williams, Nicholas S.

Chiroptera is the second most species-rich mammalian order and about 75% of bat species feed on arthropods, which makes these bats a good model group for studying complex trophic interactions. Next-generation parallel sequencing techniques allow a detailed analysis of arthropod resource partitioning patterns in bats. However, previous studies have not reached a consensus on the concordance between diet composition, habitat use, and segregation of trophic resources in bats. We analyzed diet composition in terms of taxonomy of the insect prey, and the prey characteristics. Feces of 16 bat species were examined in the Mexican Neotropics. We carried out a SIMPER (similarity percentage) test, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and principal component analyses to identify general segregation patterns of trophic resources in relation to the habitat-use guild of bats and computed Pianka's niche overlap index between species and Levin's index to estimate the niche width of each species. Bats from the same locality tend to partition their diet, with a niche overlap ranging between 0.5 and 0.8. The highest values were found between species with different foraging behaviors. We suggest that future bat diet studies should incorporate the ecological and taxonomic information of arthropod prey to better understand the trophic interactions with bats.","[Segura-Trujillo, Cintya A.] Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Univ Costa Sur, Ave Independencia Nacl 151, Autlan De Navarro 48900, Jalisco, Mexico; [Segura-Trujillo, Cintya A.; Ticul Alvarez-Castaneda, Sergio] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, SC Ave Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico; [Castaneda-Rico, Susette; Maldonado, Jesus E.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Ctr Conservat Genom, Natl Zool Pk, Washington, DC USA; [Castaneda-Rico, Susette; Maldonado, Jesus E.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Castaneda-Rico, Susette] Smithsonian Mason, Sch Conservat, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA",Universidad de Guadalajara; Telefonica SA; CIBNOR - Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas del Noroeste; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; George Mason University,"Alvarez-Castañeda, ST (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, SC Ave Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico.",,"Maldonado, Jesus/AIE-8664-2022; Castañeda-Rico, Susette/ABF-4428-2021","Segura, Cintya/0000-0002-6306-0081; Maldonado, Jesus/0000-0002-4282-1072","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia of Mexico (CONACYT) [151189, 488818/278410]; Fondo Sectorial de Investigacion para la Educacion SEP-CONACyT [251053]; American Society of Mammalogists (CAS-T); Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas del Noroeste; Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia of Mexico (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Fondo Sectorial de Investigacion para la Educacion SEP-CONACyT; American Society of Mammalogists (CAS-T); Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas del Noroeste; Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute(Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute),"We thank G.

Hardness has been defined as an important prey attribute, and in some cases a limiting factor in foraging decisions for smaller compared to larger bat species. The goal of this study was to identify which factors influence the selection of prey hardness in a vespertilionid bat community. We investigated food consumed by bats by analyzing fecal samples obtained from eight bat species coexisting in a mountain ecosystem of central Mexico and correlate non-phylogenetically and phylogenetically prey hardness to weather, bat ' s body, cranial and ultrasonic call structure variables. Results showed that diet of vespertilionid bats was mainly represented by Diptera, Neuroptera, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera consumption. The qualitative prey hardness index (From soft 1 to hard 5) ranked bats as: Myotis melanorhinus, Corynorhinus mexicanus, Myotis volans, Myotis californicus (< 3); Myotis velifer (< 4); Eptesicus fuscus, Idionycteris phyllotis and Myotis thysanodes (> 4.2). Prey hardness was positively correlated to minimum and mean temperatures, bat ' s body weight, total and forearm lengths, cranial variables as: zygomatic breadth, mandibular length, height of the coronoid process, lower molar width, C-M3 superior and inferior rows length and upper molar width; and negatively to ultrasonic variables as total slope, call duration, low and high frequencies, band width and frequency maximum power. Considering phylogenies, prey hardness positively correlated to mandibular length, C-M3 inferior and superior rows lengths (p < 0.05). Our results showed that environmental, morphological and echolocation variables can be used as predictors of preferred insect prey in a community of vespertilionid bats.","[Ayala-Berdon, Jorge] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, CONACyT, Tlaxcala De Xicohtencatl 90062, Mexico; [Martinez Gomez, Margarita; Beamonte-Barrientos, Rene; Vazquez, Jorge] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, CTBC, Tlaxcala De Xicohtencatl 90062, Mexico; [Ponce, Andres Ramirez] Inst Ecol AC INECOL, Biodiversidad & Sistemat, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Pena, Olga Nelly] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Lab Fisiol Vegetal, UBIPRO, Ave Barrios 1, Los Reyes Iztacala 54090, Tlalnepantla, Mexico",Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Gómez, MM (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, CTBC, Tlaxcala De Xicohtencatl 90062, Mexico.;Rodriguez-Peña, ON (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Lab Fisiol Vegetal, UBIPRO, Ave Barrios 1, Los Reyes Iztacala 54090, Tlalnepantla, Mexico.",,"Martinez, Margarita/KFR-3842-2024; Ramírez Ponce, Andrés/ISA-0815-2023; Ayala-Berdon, Jorge/AAZ-4140-2021; Ramirez Ponce, Andres/N-8965-2017","Ramirez Ponce, Andres/0000-0003-4742-7397; Martinez-Gomez, Margarita/0000-0002-3534-1265",Volkswagen Company; National Posdoctoral Scholarship; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) [166442]; Volkswagen Foundation,Volkswagen Company; National Posdoctoral Scholarship; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen),"This study was supported by a grant from the program Por Amor al Planeta 2013, granted by the Volkswagen Company to MMG for financing the fieldwork; and a National Posdoctoral Scholarship to Dr. Nelly Rodriguez-Pena was provided by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT No. 166442).Volkswagen Foundation,Por Amor al Planeta 2013,Margarita Mar-tinez Gomez,CONACyT,166442,Nelly Rodriguez",,96,4,4,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2199-2401,2199-241X,,MAMMAL RES,Mammal Res.,JUL,2023,68,3,,,,,273,282,,10.1007/s13364-023-00678-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-023-00678-2,,MAR 2023,10,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,I4JF2,,hybrid,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000950517400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

High taxonomic diversity is closely linked to vegetation structure in woody pastures, but examining functional characteristics of species assemblages can shed more light on the ecological mechanisms driving divergent responses to habitat characteristics and help guide good management practices. To this end, we use a multi-taxa approach to investigate how plant, bat and bird taxonomic and functional diversity are affected by pasture tree and shrub density, structural complexity and proximate forest cover in southern Sweden. In particular, we use a trait exclusion approach to estimate the sensitivity of diversity-environment relationships to specific traits. We found little congruence between corresponding diversity metrics across taxa. Bird species richness responded stronger to environmental variables than functional diversity metrics, whereas the functional response to the environment was stronger than the taxonomic response among plants and bats. While increasing tree densities increased the taxonomic diversity of all three taxa, a simultaneous functional response was only evident for plants. Contrasting measures of vegetation structure affected different aspects of functional diversity across taxa, driven by different traits. For plants and birds, traits linked to resource use contributed particularly to the functional response, whereas body mass had stronger influence on bat functional diversity metrics. Multi-taxa functional approaches are essential to understand the effects of woody pasture structural attributes on biodiversity, and ultimately inform management guidelines to preserve the biological values in woody pastures.","[Jakobsson, Simon] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, POB 5685, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Jakobsson, Simon; Wood, Heather; Lindborg, Regina] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Biogeog & Geomat, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ekroos, Johan] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Stockholm University; Lund University,"Jakobsson, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res, POB 5685, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway.;Jakobsson, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Biogeog & Geomat, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",simon.jakobsson@nina.no,"Jakobsson, Simon/AAE-9060-2020","Jakobsson, Simon/0000-0003-1703-0145","Norwegian institute for nature research; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS) [2011-977]; Ahlmann's foundation; Albert and Maria Bergstrom's foundation","Norwegian institute for nature research(Bioforsk); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Ahlmann's foundation; Albert and Maria Bergstrom's foundation","Open Access funding provided by Norwegian institute for nature research.

Although secondary forest is an expanding type of landscape matrix that has been shown to buffer some of the negative consequences of forest loss and fragmentation on taxonomic diversity, little is known in this regard about the functional dimension of biodiversity. We took advantage of an ecosystem-wide fragmentation experiment to investigate longer term changes in functional diversity of a mega-diverse Amazonian bat assemblage associated with regrowth development in the matrix. We found that matrix regeneration affected several facets of bat functional diversity in secondary forest over time, increasing functional alpha diversity, species- and community-level functional uniqueness, altering functional trait composition, and resulting in functional beta-diversity changes via trait gains. However, approximately 30 years of matrix regeneration were insufficient for functional diversity to recover to the same levels as in continuous forest. Our results suggest that a combination of natural, humanassisted, and active restoration is likely to be the most successful strategy for restoring functional biodiversity of bats in human-modified tropical landscapes, a finding that most likely also applies to many other taxa.","[Farneda, Fabio Z.; Grelle, Carlos E.

Here, we investigate the effect of the distance to the nearest watercourse, terrain elevation, vegetation clutter, basal area and canopy height on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and on the predominance of some functional traits (body mass, wing morphology and trophic level) of bat assemblages (phyllostomid and mormoopid bats) in a terra firme forest, in the northeastern Brazilian Amazon. We captured bats using mist nets in 15 permanent plots over a 25 km(2) area of continuous forest. We captured 279 individuals belonging to 28 species with a total of 77.760 m(2).h of sampling effort. Our results showed that bat richness increases as a function of distance to the nearest watercourse and that the assemblage also changes, with more diverse taxonomic and functional groups in areas further from the watercourse. Furthermore, elevation positively affects species richness, and the basal area of the forest positively influences the average body mass of bats. Taken together, our results demonstrate that subtle variations in the environmental conditions along a local scale gradient impact on the main dimensions of bat diversity in primary forests.","[Ferreira, Marcelo Martins; Hilario, Renato; da Cunha, Alan Cavalcanti; de Toledo, Jose Julio; Douglas Carvalho, William] Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade Trop, Macapa, Brazil; [Xavier, Bruna da Silva] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Ferreira, Marcelo Martins; Dineli Bobrowiec, Paulo Estefano] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonia INPA, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Manaus, Brazil; [de Castro, Isai Jorge] Inst Pesquisas Cient & Tecnol Estado Amapa IEPA, Lab Mamiferos, Macapa, Brazil; [Oliveira, Leidiane Leao] Univ Fed Oeste Para, Inst Ciencias & Tecnol Aguas, Santarem, Brazil; [Douglas Carvalho, William] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Terr Ecol Grp TEG UAM, Madrid, Spain; [Douglas Carvalho, William] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Invest Biodivers & Cambio Global CIBC UAM, Madrid, Spain",Fundacao Universidade Federal do Amapa; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Universidade Federal do Oeste do Para; Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Ferreira, MM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade Trop, Macapa, Brazil.;Ferreira, MM (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonia INPA, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Manaus, Brazil.",uthiramartins@gmail.com,"Hilário, Renato/A-7158-2013; Xavier, Bruna/K-2260-2016; de Toledo, José/V-2465-2019; Da Cunha, Alan/KBC-3017-2024; Bobrowiec, Paulo/A-2630-2013; Oliveira, Leidiane/LVS-5282-2024; Castro, Isai/I-5094-2013; Carvalho, William Douglas/H-7894-2015","Martins, Marcelo/0000-0002-1951-4023; Castro, Isai/0000-0003-2924-7886; Carvalho, William Douglas/0000-0003-2518-9148; Xavier, Bruna/0000-0001-9390-5041; Hilario, Renato/0000-0002-0346-0921","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Brazil; Ayudas Maria Zambrano - Spanish Ministry of Universities [CA3/ RSUE/2021-00197]","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Ayudas Maria Zambrano - Spanish Ministry of Universities","MMF and BSX were supported, respectively, by master and doctoral scholarships from the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Brazil.

Although hibernacula selection has received considerable attention, few studies have examined the characteristics of mines used as summer roosts and autumn swarming sites. Abandoned mines are hazardous and often sealed to prevent human access. Alternatively, abandoned mines sometimes are gated to protect mine-roosting bats by deterring human entrance. However, gates and other mine entrance characteristics may affect bat presence and use. We examined the external characteristics of mines that could be measured safely and quickly to determine if they influenced bat species presence and relative frequency. We surveyed bats at 36 abandoned coal mine entrances during summer 2002 and 47 mine entrances (the same 36 as during summer and 11 additional mines) during autumn 2002 at New River Gorge National River and Gauley River National Recreation Area, West Virginia, USA. We captured 139 bats during summer and 1, 733 bats during autumn of 9 different species. During autumn, more bat species used mines with isolated entrances than those with multiple entrances. Our results indicate that gates do not affect bats in terms of presence or frequency of use as much as mine entrance shape and proximity to other portals. Mine entrance size and shape positively influenced bat activity, particularly that of little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) and eastern pipistrelle (Pipistrellus subflavus), which were among the most commonly captured species. Spatial proximity of entrances should be considered in bat management decisions concerning abandoned mines.","W Virginia Univ, W Virginia Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry, Wildlife & Fisheries Resources Program, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry, W Virginia Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University; West Virginia University; West Virginia University; West Virginia University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Johnson, JB (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Appalachian Lab, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA.",j-johnson3@juno.com,,,,,,,51,9,12,1,24,WILDLIFE SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2197 USA",0091-7648,,,WILDLIFE SOC B,Wildl.

Species trait variation determine the spatial scales at which organisms perceive the environment. Despite this knowledge, the coupling of all these factors to understand how diversity is structured is still deficient. Here, we review the role of ecological and evolutionary processes operating across different hierarchically spatial scales to shape diversity patterns of bats-the second largest mammal order and the only mammals with real flight capability. Main body: We observed that flight development and its provision of increased dispersal ability influenced the diversification, life history, geographic distribution, and local interspecific interactions of bats, differently across multiple spatial scales. Niche packing combined with different flight, foraging and echolocation strategies and differential use of air space allowed the coexistence among bats as well as for an increased diversity supported by the environment. Considering distinct bat species distributions across space due to their functional characteristics, we assert that understanding such characteristics in Chiroptera improves the knowledge on ecological processes at different scales. We also point two main knowledge gaps that limit progress on the knowledge on scale-dependence of ecological and evolutionary processes in bats: a geographical bias, showing that research on bats is mainly done in the New World; and the lack of studies addressing the mesoscale (i.e. landscape and metacommunity scales). Conclusions: We propose that it is essential to couple spatial scales and different zoogeographical regions along with their functional traits, to address bat diversity patterns and understand how they are distributed across the environment. Understanding how bats perceive space is a complex task: all bats can fly, but their perception of space varies with their biological traits.","[Peixoto, Franciele Parreira] Univ Fed Goias, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Braga, Pedro Henrique Pereira] Concordia Univ, Grad Program Biol, Dept Biol, Loyola Campus,7141 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H2R 2K7, Canada; [Mendes, Poliana] Univ Vila Velha, Lab Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidade, Posgrad Ecol Ecossistemas, Ctr Bioprat, Rua Mercurio,Boa Vista 1, BR-29101420 Vila Velha, ES, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Goias; Concordia University - Canada; Centro Universitario Vila Velha,"Braga, PHP (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Grad Program Biol, Dept Biol, Loyola Campus,7141 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H2R 2K7, Canada.",pedrohenrique.pereirabraga@mail.concordia.ca,"Mendes, Poliana/GYA-1263-2022; Pereira Braga, Pedro Henrique/L-4917-2019","Pereira Braga, Pedro Henrique/0000-0002-1308-1562","Goias Research Support Foundation (FAPEG); Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development [CNPq 248975/2013-0, CNPq 150653/2015-8]",Goias Research Support Foundation (FAPEG); Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),Franciele Parreira Peixoto is funded by a scholarship provided by the Goias Research Support Foundation (FAPEG).

Almost 150 years ago, an unusual fleshy structure on the chest was discovered in an adult male little white-shouldered bat, Ametrida centurio, specimen stored in the collection of the British Museum (London). In addition to sexual differences in body size in this species, males also had swollen pads below their eyes. Here we show that there are other important sexually dimorphic traits that previously were not found in museum specimens, reinforcing how important complementary observations of live animals are for discovering traits that have been unnoticed for centuries. We report two new, unusual, presumably-but still not confirmed-glandular structures in male A. centurio, hereafter referred to as axillary and genital traits. The axillary structure is a hairless, reddened and moist area located beneath each wing, observed when wings are elevated. The genital structure surrounds the penis and coats the scrotal area and adjacent fur with a thick secretion. Combined, observations of these sexually dimorphic traits, and the larger size of females compared to males, makes A. centurio a species with five sexually dimorphic characters. The nature, development, function, and variation of these male traits remain unknown. Future field studies should focus on careful observation of bat behavior to shed light on the function of these intriguing traits, and give us a better understanding of sexual selection.","[Munoz-Romo, Mariana; Page, Rachel A.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa 084303092, Ancon, Panama; [Vilar, Emmanuel Messias] Univ Fed Paraiba, Lab Mamiferos, Dept Sistemat & Ecol, Ctr Ciencias Exatas & Nat, Campus 1, BR-58059900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; [Vilar, Emmanuel Messias] Univ Fed Paraiba, Programa Posgrad Zool, Campus 1, BR-58059900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; [Dewynter, Mael] 55 Residence Plage, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Lim, Burton K.] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Munoz-Romo, Mariana] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Lab Zool Aplicada, Merida 5101, Venezuela",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Universidade Federal da Paraiba; Universidade Federal da Paraiba; Royal Ontario Museum; University of Los Andes Venezuela,"Muñoz-Romo, M (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa 084303092, Ancon, Panama.;Muñoz-Romo, M (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Lab Zool Aplicada, Merida 5101, Venezuela.",munozromoml@si.edu; messiashp@gmail.com; mael.dewynter@gmail.com; burtonl@rom.on.ca; pager@si.edu,"Muñoz-Romo, Mariana/AEN-8478-2022; Page, Rachel/GQQ-2818-2022; Lim, Burton/A-1148-2011","Page, Rachel/0000-0001-7072-0669; Lim, Burton/0000-0002-0884-0421; Dewynter, Mael/0000-0002-5288-3429; Munoz-Romo, Mariana/0000-0002-6595-7386; Vilar, Emmanuel/0000-0003-0108-7841",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CNPq [457524/2012-0]; Environmental Services & Support (ESS) N.V. in Paramaribo,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Environmental Services & Support (ESS) N.V. in Paramaribo,"EMV was funded by a Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), masters and doctoral grant and Rede BioM.A. Inventarios: Padroes de diversidade, biogeografia e endemismo de especies de mamiferos, aves, anfibios, drosofilas e parasitos na Mata Atlantica (CNPq-Processo: 457524/2012-0).

However, the dispersal agent for these tropical plant lineages remains puzzling. Here, we investigate which frugivory-related traits may have facilitated past intercontinental long-distance dispersal in the custard apple family (Annonaceae), a major vertebrate-dispersed tropical plant family. We hypothesize that long-distance dispersal was associated with the evolution of traits related to dispersal by large-bodied mammals (e.g., large, dull-coloured, megafaunal fruits) and strong-flying, ocean-crossing birds and bats (e.g., dehiscent, moniliform or cauliflorous fruits). Location Global. Taxon Annonaceae. Methods We used a fossil-calibrated phylogenetic framework to infer the biogeographic history of 234 Annonaceae species (10%, covering nearly all genera) in relation to the evolution of 15 frugivory-related traits, using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inferences. Furthermore, we used linear and generalized linear models and phylogenetic simulations to test whether ancestral fruit traits during intercontinental dispersal were different from those of other lineages not involved in long-distance dispersal. Results We inferred the ancestral Annonaceae fruits to be small with a single or few small seeds and a small number of fruitlets. These fruits were most probably apocarpous, indehiscent and/or moniliform (i.e., long beads of fruitlets). Furthermore, most of the long-distance dispersal events in Annonaceae occurred via the expanded tropical forests in the Early Cenozoic (geodispersal), and were significantly associated with large (c. 3 cm long), dull-coloured fruits and short stipes. Additionally, long-distance dispersal was also facilitated by dehiscent, moniliform and non-cauliflorous fruits. Main conclusions We suggest that the evolution of frugivory-related traits associated with dispersal by frugivores that frequently move across large distances and/or barriers, such as large-bodied mammals and strong-flying birds, has contributed to the disjunct tropical biogeographical distribution of Annonaceae, and probably of tropical rain forest plants more generally.","[Onstein, Renske E.; Sauquet, Herve] Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, AgroParisTech, Ecol Systemat Evolut, Orsay, France; [Onstein, Renske E.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Kissling, W.

We aimed to identify abiotic factors driving the assembly of bat communities in Eastern Mediterranean pine plantations along a north-south climatic gradient, as they are crucial forest habitats for the assessment and conservation of these communities. We expected that bat communities are predominantly shaped by environmental filtering. We conducted acoustic sampling in 35 pine plantations in Israel and analyzed recordings for species identification. We used the ESLTP analysis, an extension of the three-table ordination (RLQ analysis), to explore relationships between environmental characteristics, species occurrences, and functional traits of species while accounting for phylogenetic relationships between species and spatial distribution of the communities. Communities showed phylogenetic and trait clustering. Climatic conditions and forest vegetation composition shaped communities of bats, affecting the distribution of traits related to foraging behaviors, vegetation clutter, and the ability of bats to maneuver in it. Maneuverable species were associated with the northern Mediterranean climatic zone, with a scarce cover of drought-tolerant small shrubs and grassland. Fast flyers were associated with the center-south semi-arid area, with abundant drought-tolerant small shrubs and grassland. These forces might have a predominant role in the assembly of these communities, presumably due to the stressful climatic conditions of the study area. The ESLTP approach can be extended to other taxa and environments to predict species responses to disturbance and environmental changes and give insights into environmental management. Bat communities along a natural gradient of temperature and precipitation in pine forests were studied. Bat communities showed phylogenetic and trait clustering. These communities are shaped by climate conditions and forest vegetation composition.

The individuals presented in GenBank as N. kolenatii represent three different genetic lines. The Belarusian samples belong to the central haplotype KH1. Bat flies in Belarus were found on two species of bats: M. daubentonii and M. dasycneme. . The genetic heterogeneity of representatives of N. kolenatii and the detected variability of taxonomically significant morphological characters may indicate both incorrect species identification of N. kolenatii sequences deposited in GenBank, as well as the presence of cryptic species among representatives of this group. The hidden genetic diversity and identified morphological features of species of the genus Nycteribia require further study, including taxonomic revision based on comprehensive morphological and genetic analysis.","[Larchanka, Aleksandra I.; V.

However, several descriptive-comparative and morphofunctional studies about the scapular girdles and forelimbs and their importance in the wing-beat cycle are well known and documented. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that there is a conjunction of factors that influences the size and shape of the scapula in bats, such as phylogenetic effects and lifestyle traits. We analyzed the variation in size and shape of the scapula of six families of bats (277 specimens from 91 species) using geometric morphometrics in a phylogenetic context. The results indicate that phylogenetic signal for both size and shape of the scapula is strong. The phylomorphospace indicates a clear separation by families, with Phyllostomidae and Molossidae being the most different from each other. Phylogenetic signal was also strong for size and shape of the scapula within the family Phyllostomidae. According to phylogenetic analyses of variance, the shape and size of the scapula are not affected by the lifestyle of the bats, independently of phylogeny, except for the type of flight in Vespertilionidae. The results in this family indicate that, in addition to strong phylogenetic signal in scapular morphology, there is evidence of some evolutionary convergence that supports an adaptive interpretation. However, the assessments to test morphological convergence failed to find phenotypic similarity within states of lifestyle traits, except for insectivore species which presented some degree of morphological resemblance in the shape of the scapula. Thus, it seems that at higher taxonomic levels (e.g., among families) the morphology of the scapula is phylogenetically conserved, whereas patterns of convergent evolution are visible at lower taxonomic levels (e.g., within families).","[Gaudioso, Pablo J.; Barquez, Ruben M.; Monica Diaz, M.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Ciencias Nat, Programa Invest Biodiversidad Argentina PIDBA, Miguel Lillo 205, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Gaudioso, Pablo J.; Barquez, Ruben M.; Monica Diaz, M.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, CONICET, Inst Miguel Lillo, PCMA, Miguel Lillo 205, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Gaudioso, Pablo J.] Univ Nacl Chilecito, IAMRA, Chilecito, Argentina; [Martinez, Juan J.] Inst Ecorreg Andinas INECOA, San Salvador De Jujuy, Argentina; [Martinez, Juan J.] CONICET UNJu, San Salvador De Jujuy, Argentina; [Monica Diaz, M.] Fdn Miguel Lillo, San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina",Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Miguel Lillo Foundation; Universidad Nacional de Chilecito (UNDEC); Miguel Lillo Foundation; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Díaz, MM (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Ciencias Nat, Programa Invest Biodiversidad Argentina PIDBA, Miguel Lillo 205, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina.;Díaz, MM (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Tucuman, CONICET, Inst Miguel Lillo, PCMA, Miguel Lillo 205, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina.",pablogaudioso@hotmail.com; bio.jjmartinez@gmail.com; rubenbarquez@gmail.com; mmonicadiaz@yahoo.com.ar,"Martinez, Juan Jose/AAG-4611-2020; Díaz, M./HNQ-6301-2023","Gaudioso, Pablo Javier/0000-0003-4773-2789; Diaz, Monica/0000-0001-9519-6461","Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT 2016-0359]; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas; Facultad de Ciencias Naturales e Instituto Miguel Lillo; Coleccion Mamiferos Lillo (CML); Universidad Nacional de Tucuman, Argentina; United States Public Health Service National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, USA [R01TW005860, D43TW007120, K24AI068903]","Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); Facultad de Ciencias Naturales e Instituto Miguel Lillo; Coleccion Mamiferos Lillo (CML); Universidad Nacional de Tucuman, Argentina; United States Public Health Service National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, USA","Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Grant/Award Number: PICT 2016-0359; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas; Facultad de Ciencias Naturales e Instituto Miguel Lillo and Coleccion Mamiferos Lillo (CML); Universidad Nacional de Tucuman, Argentina; United States Public Health Service National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, USA, Grant/Award Number: R01TW005860, D43TW007120 and K24AI068903",,65,11,11,0,16,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",0947-5745,1439-0469,,J ZOOL SYST EVOL RES,J.

Assembly of species into communities following human disturbance (e.g., deforestation, fragmentation) may be governed by spatial (e.g., dispersal) or environmental (e.g., niche partitioning) mechanisms. Variation partitioning has been used to broadly disentangle spatial and environmental mechanisms, and approaches utilizing functional and phylogenetic characteristics of communities have been implemented to determine the relative importance of particular environmental (or niche-based) mechanisms. Nonetheless, few studies have integrated these quantitative approaches to comprehensively assess the relative importance of particular structuring processes. Methods. We employed a novel variation partitioning approach to evaluate the relative importance of particular spatial and environmental drivers of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic aspects of bat communities in a human-modified landscape in Costa Rica. Specifically, we estimated the amount of variation in species composition (taxonomic structure) and in two aspects of functional and phylogenetic structure (i.e., composition and dispersion) along a forest loss and fragmentation gradient that are uniquely explained by landscape characteristics (i.e., environment) or space to assess the importance of competing mechanisms. Results. The unique effects of space on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic structure were consistently small. In contrast, landscape characteristics (i.e., environment) played an appreciable role in structuring bat communities. Spatially-structured landscape characteristics explained 84% of the variation in functional or phylogenetic dispersion, and the unique effects of landscape characteristics significantly explained 14% of the variation in species composition. Furthermore, variation in bat community structure was primarily due to differences in dispersion of species within functional or phylogenetic space along the gradient, rather than due to differences in functional or phylogenetic composition. Discussion. Variation among bat communities was related to environmental mechanisms, especially niche-based (i.e., environmental) processes, rather than spatial mechanisms. High variation in functional or phylogenetic dispersion, as opposed to functional or phylogenetic composition, suggests that loss or gain of niche space is driving the progressive loss or gain of species with particular traits from communities along the human-modified gradient. Thus, environmental characteristics associated with landscape structure influence functional or phylogenetic aspects of bat communities by effectively altering the ways in which species partition niche space.","[Cisneros, Laura M.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Fagan, Matthew E.] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Geog & Environm Syst, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT USA",University of Connecticut; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Cisneros, LM (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",laura.cisneros@uconn.edu,,"Fagan, Matthew E./0000-0002-8023-9251; Willig, Michael/0000-0001-6884-9957","Student Research Scholarship from Bat Conservation International; Organization for Tropical Studies; American Society of Mammalogists; Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, at the University of Connecticut (UCONN); Center for Conservation and Biodiversity, at the University of Connecticut (UCONN); Multicultural Fellowship from Graduate School at UCONN; National Science Foundation [DEB-1050680]","Student Research Scholarship from Bat Conservation International; Organization for Tropical Studies; American Society of Mammalogists; Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, at the University of Connecticut (UCONN); Center for Conservation and Biodiversity, at the University of Connecticut (UCONN); Multicultural Fellowship from Graduate School at UCONN; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported by a Student Research Scholarship from Bat Conservation International, a Research Fellowship from the Organization for Tropical Studies, two Grants-in-Aid Awards from the American Society of Mammalogists, and many intramural awards from the Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Center for Conservation and Biodiversity, all at the University of Connecticut (UCONN).

Tri-colored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) populations have declined drastically in areas where WNS has been found, leading to the decision to protect tri-colored bats under the federal Endangered Species Act in the United States. At this time, there has not been a thorough review of the literature, nor a concise summary of the tri-colored bat's life history, diet, threats, or habitat preferences. This absence creates more work for policy makers, federal Take permit applicants, and conservationists to find, access, and review critical details of tri-colored bats. A major point of confusion stems from the multiple common names and genera tri-colored bats have been classified under since it was first described a century and a half ago. To address the lack of concise summary, we scoured the scientific literature and compiled nearly a century of data to provide a robust review of the ecology, life history, winter and summer habitats, as well as created maps and figures showing counties where studies have occurred, white-nose syndrome is present, and where bats have been documented.

However, few studies have investigated the trait-environment relationships that underpin diverse animal relationships with vegetation structure. We used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and acoustic bat surveys to investigate relationships between forest structure and bat communities across a vegetation structural gradient at community, species and trait levels. We developed 20 measures of site scale vegetation structure and also quantified landscape scale vegetation cover and water availability. We predicted that overall bat activity would increase in open and decrease in cluttered vegetation, but this would vary with species, underpinned by ecomorphological traits. Overall bat activity was negatively associated with stem density, with total activity halving (from 380 to 190 calls night(-1)) as stem densities increased from 60 to 1350 stems ha(-1), while foraging activity declined from 8 to <1 feeding buzzes night(-1) over the same range. Bat activity varied among species and structures and foraging strategy explained more of this variability than call, body size or wing traits. As predicted, above canopy and edge-space foraging bats were negatively associated with local-scale clutter, while closed-space species were positively associated with cluttered stands. Stem density was the strongest predictor of bat-environment relationships, although there was evidence for differences in bat habitat use across different structural elements. Our study is the first to link detailed LiDAR-derived 3D forest structural metrics to multiple animal traits.

Niche theory predicts that increasing species richness in assemblages can either lead to denser packing of niche space ('niche packing') or an expansion into its novel regions ('niche expansion'). Traditionally, these scenarios have been studied using functional traits but stable isotopes provide advantages such as identifying the degree of resource specialisation, or niche partitioning among functionally similar species. In this study, we evaluate the relevance of niche packing versus niche expansion by investigating stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic niche width and overlap among 23 bat species from six functional groups across a 1500 m elevational gradient in the Himalaya. Our results suggest that an increase in species richness in the low elevation is accompanied by small niche width with high overlap, whereas the high elevation assemblage shows large niche width with low overlap among functional group members. At the functional group level, edge-space foraging, trawling, and active gleaning bats have the highest niche width while passive gleaning bats that are only found in high elevations are isotopic specialists showing low overlap with other groups. Edge and open-space foraging bats showed idiosyncratic changes in niche width across elevations. We also find that the niches of rhinolophid bats overlap with edge-space and open-space foraging bats despite their unique functional traits. These results support the idea that at low elevations high species richness is associated with niche packing while at high elevations strong niche partitioning prevails in dynamic and resource-poor environments. We conclude that although high elevation animal assemblages are often 'functionally underdispersed', that is show homogenous functional traits, our approach based on stable isotopes demonstrates niche partitioning among such functionally similar species.","[Chakravarty, Rohit; Radchuk, Viktoriia; Voigt, Christian C.] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Berlin, Germany; [Chakravarty, Rohit; Voigt, Christian C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Anim Behav, Berlin, Germany; [Managave, Shreyas] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER Pune, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, Pune, India",Leibniz Institut fur Zoo und Wildtierforschung; Free University of Berlin; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) Pune,"Chakravarty, R (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Berlin, Germany.;Chakravarty, R (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Anim Behav, Berlin, Germany.",rohit.chakravarty77@gmail.com,"Chakravarty, Rohit/GWM-8927-2022; Radchuk, Viktoriia/C-6665-2013","Managave, Shreyas/0000-0003-3275-1936; Voigt, Christian/0000-0002-0706-3974; Radchuk, Viktoriia/0000-0003-3072-0095",Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst [57381412]; Elisabeth Kalko-Stiftung; Idea Wild; Rufford Foundation [24477-2],Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Elisabeth Kalko-Stiftung; Idea Wild; Rufford Foundation,"Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Grant/Award Number: 57381412; Elisabeth Kalko-Stiftung; Idea Wild; Rufford Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 24477-2",,58,5,5,3,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

These declines can be partially mitigated through actions that boost reproductive success; therefore, management aimed at promoting availability of high-quality roosting habitat is an important conservation goal. Following the principles of the umbrella species concept, if co-occurring species share similar roost-tree preferences, then management practices targeting one species may confer conservation benefits to another. We conducted a systematic review of roost-site characteristics of thirteen species inhabiting eastern temperate forests to: (1) synthesize existing knowledge across species; (2) assess niche overlap among co-occurring species; and (3) evaluate the potential for currently protected species to serve as conservation umbrellas. We performed multivariate ordination techniques to group species based on the seven most-reported roost-site characteristics, including tree species, diameter at breast height, tree health, roost type, tree height, canopy closure, and roost height. Species sorted into three roosting guilds: (1) southern wetland inhabitants; (2) foliage specialists; and (3) dead tree generalists. Myotis septentrionalis and Perimyotis subflavus had significant roost-niche overlap with five and four other species respectively, and their existing protections make them suitable umbrellas for other bats in the North American eastern temperate forests.","[Drake, Evan C.; Maslo, Brooke] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Gignoux-Wolfsohn, Sarah] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center,"Drake, EC (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",evan.drake@rutgers.edu; gw.sarah@gmail.com; brooke.maslo@rutgers.edu,"Drake, Evan/JCN-9375-2023","Gignoux-Wolfsohn, Sarah/0000-0002-9037-1088",,,,,187,16,17,5,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,FEB,2020,12,2,,,,,,,76,10.3390/d12020076,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d12020076,,,26,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KT6HP,,gold,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000519115400033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Megabats are crepuscular and rely on a well-developed eyes and visual pathway, whereas microbats occupy a nocturnal niche and use acoustic orientation or echolocation more than vision as the major means of perceiving their environment. In view of the differences associated with their sensory systems, we decided to investigate the function and evolution of color vision (opsin genes) in these two suborders of bats. The middle/long wavelength (M/L) and short wavelength (S) opsin genes were sequenced from two frugivorous species of megabats, Haplonycteris fischeri and Pteropus dasymallus formosus, and one insectivorous species of microbat, Myotis velifer. Contrary to the situation in primates, where many nocturnal species have lost the functional S opsin gene, both crepuscular and strictly nocturnal species of bats that we examined have functional M/L and S opsin genes. Surprisingly, the S opsin in these bats may be sensitive to UV light, which is relatively more abundant at dawn and at dusk. The M/L opsin in these bats appears to be the L type, which is sensitive to red and may be helpful for identifying fruits among leaves or for other purposes. Most interestingly, H. fischeri has a recent duplication of the M/L opsin gene, representing to date the only known case of opsin gene duplication in non-primate mammals. Some of these observations are unexpected and may provide insights into the effect of nocturnal life on the evolution of opsin genes in mammals and the evolution of the life history traits of bats in general.","Acad Sinica, Inst Zool, Taipei, Taiwan; Taipei Zoo, Taipei, Taiwan; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Human Genet, Houston, TX USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Chicago,"Acad Sinica, Inst Zool, Taipei, Taiwan.",whli@uchicago.edu,"Oakley, Todd/A-5419-2008; Mower, Jeffrey/B-7875-2008","Li, Wen-Hsiung/0000-0003-1086-1456; Mower, Jeffrey/0000-0002-1501-5809; Oakley, Todd/0000-0002-4478-915X",NICHD NIH HHS [HD38387] Funding Source: Medline; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM54499] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NIGMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),,,62,76,90,1,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0737-4038,1537-1719,,MOL BIOL EVOL,Mol.

Their feeding niche diversification has shaped skull and wing morphologies through natural selection, reflecting food processing and flight strategies. Yet, evolution of bat hindlimbs, especially in phyllostomids, remains little understood. Previous studies highlighted the femur's morphology as a key to understanding the evolution of quadrupedalism in yangochiropteran bats, including the adept walking observed in vampire bats (Desmodontinae). Here, we aimed to describe the femoral morphological variation in Phyllostomidae, correlating this with body size and assessing the effects of phylogenetic history, dietary habits, and hindlimb usage. Analyzing 15 femoral traits from 45 species across 9 subfamilies through phylogenetically informed methods, we discovered a significant phylogenetic structure in femoral morphology. Allometric analysis indicated that body mass accounts for about 85% of the variance in phyllostomid femoral size and about 11% in femoral shape. Relatively smaller femurs showed to be typical in Stenodermatinae, Lonchophyllinae, and Glossophaginae, in contrast to the larger femurs of Phyllostominae, Desmodontinae, Micronycterinae, and Lonchorrhininae. Furthermore, extensive femur shape variation was detected, with the most distinct morphologies in vampire bats, followed by frugivorous species. Adaptive evolutionary models related to diet more effectively explained variations in femoral relative size and shape than stochastic models. Contrary to the conventional belief of limited functional demand on bat femurs, our findings suggest that femoral morphology is significantly influenced by functional demands associated with diet and food capture, in addition to being partially structured by body size and shared evolutionary history.","[Louzada, Nathalia Siqueira Verissimo; Tavares, William Correa] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Nucleo Multidisciplinar Pesquisa Biol, Campus UFRJ Duque Caxias Prof Geraldo Cidade,Rodov, BR-25265970 Duque De Caxias, RJ, Brazil; [Louzada, Nathalia Siqueira Verissimo; Tavares, William Correa] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade & Biol Evolut, Inst Biol, Av Carlos Chagas Filho,373,Sala A1-050,Cidade Univ, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Louzada, NSV (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Nucleo Multidisciplinar Pesquisa Biol, Campus UFRJ Duque Caxias Prof Geraldo Cidade,Rodov, BR-25265970 Duque De Caxias, RJ, Brazil.;Louzada, NSV (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade & Biol Evolut, Inst Biol, Av Carlos Chagas Filho,373,Sala A1-050,Cidade Univ, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",louzada.tata@gmail.com,"Tavares, William/AAM-3362-2021","Louzada, Nathalia/0000-0002-2370-5447; Tavares, William/0000-0003-3385-7265","Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [PDR-E39/2021, E-26/200.957/2023, E-26/210.339/2022]",Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)),"Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ): PDR-E39/2021, Grant/Award Numbers: E-26/200.957/2023 (NSVL), E-26/210.339/2022 (WCT)",,74,0,0,3,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1932-8486,1932-8494,,ANAT REC,Anat.

While there is evidence for these relationships across global data sets, they are often too broad in scale and do not consider the particularities of local to regional species pools. This decreases their usefulness for developing predictive models at scales relevant for conservation and management. We tested for trade-offs between traits and relationships with environmental gradients in trees and shrubs sampled across southern African savannas and explored evidence for acquisitive versus conservative resource-use strategies using a phylogenetically explicit approach. We found a distinct trade-off between two major poles of specialization indicative of acquisitive (high leaf nitrogen concentration, leaf phosphorus concentration, leaf N:P, specific leaf area and average leaf area) and conservative resource-use strategies (high leaf carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N), tensile strength and leaf dry matter content). Although we found that trait variance and species occurrence were constrained by phylogeny, phylogenetically informed analyses did not contradict non-phylogenetic analyses, strengthening relationships in most cases. The high intrasite trait variability and weak relationships with soils and climate may in part be explained by the high levels of deciduousness and disturbance (i.e. fire and herbivory) inherent in African savannas.Synthesis. The relationships between traits and between traits and environmental gradients were far weaker than, and often contradictory to, broad-scale studies that compare these relationships across biomes and growth forms, cautioning against making generalizations about relationships at specific sites based on broad-scale analyses.","[Wigley, Benjamin J.] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, GKVK, Bellary Rd, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India; [Wigley, Benjamin J.; Coetsee, Corli] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Sch Nat Resource Management, Saasveld Campus, George, South Africa; [Wigley, Benjamin J.; Fritz, Herve] Univ Lyon 1, LBBE, UMR CNRS 5558, Bat Gregor Mendel 43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Slingsby, Jasper A.; Bond, William J.] Fynbos Node, South African Environm Observat Network, Private Bag X7,7735 Rhodes Dr, Newlands, South Africa; [Slingsby, Jasper A.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Dept Biol Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Diaz, Sandra] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, Casilla Correo 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Diaz, Sandra] Univ Nacl Cordoba, FCEFyN, Casilla Correo 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Bond, William J.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Coetsee, Corli] Kruger Natl Pk, Sci Serv, Private Bag X402, ZA-1350 Skukuza, South Africa",Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS); Nelson Mandela University; VetAgro Sup; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON); University of Cape Town; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of Cordoba; National University of Cordoba; University of Cape Town,"Wigley, BJ (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, GKVK, Bellary Rd, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India.;Wigley, BJ (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Sch Nat Resource Management, Saasveld Campus, George, South Africa.;Wigley, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, LBBE, UMR CNRS 5558, Bat Gregor Mendel 43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",benwigley@gmail.com,"Wigley, Benjamin/K-6870-2019; Díaz, Sandra/Q-9804-2018; Bond, William/AAY-7631-2020; Slingsby, Jasper/AAU-7259-2021; Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014","Bond, William/0000-0002-3441-2084; Slingsby, Jasper/0000-0003-1246-1181; Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661",CNRS; Andrew W Mellon Foundation; SANParks; Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife; Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority; CNRS Zone Atelier Hwange (Hwange LTER),CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Andrew W Mellon Foundation; SANParks; Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife; Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority; CNRS Zone Atelier Hwange (Hwange LTER),"This work was funded through a BDI-PED grant from the CNRS as well as the Andrew W Mellon Foundation.

They control host population sizes and contribute to ecosystem functioning. However, surveys on species diversity rarely include parasitic species. Bats often present traits favoring parasite diversity, such as large home ranges, long life spans, and large colonies. The most conspicuous bat parasites are the highly host-specific, blood-sucking bat flies (Diptera: Streblidae, Nycteribiidae). Recent studies have found a direct effect of habitat alteration on the abundance of bat species. We expected, therefore, that changes in the host community in response to anthropogenic habitat modification will also result in changes in the associated parasite community. We captured bats in three different habitats in Central Panama between 2013 and 2015. We recorded information on prevalence and intensity of bat fly parasitization of the seven most commonly captured bat species. Prevalence and intensity were both significantly influenced by roost type, abundance, and host sex and age. We found that habitat variables and matrix type significantly influenced the prevalence and intensity of parasitization, while the direction of the responses was host species- and parasite species-specific. In general, roosting conditions and behavior of host bats appear to be fundamental in explaining changes in prevalence and intensity of parasitization between different habitat types, as bat flies are bound to the roost during their reproductive cycle. Habitat alterations affect next to the host community composition also the availability of possible roost structures as well as microclimatic conditions, which all three reflect in parasitization. in Spanish is available with online material.","[Hiller, Thomas; Braendel, Stefan Dominik; Honner, Benjamin; Tschapka, Marco] Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Hiller, Thomas; Braendel, Stefan Dominik; Page, Rachel A.; Tschapka, Marco] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama",Ulm University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Hiller, T (corresponding author), Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.",thomas.hiller@alumni.uni-ulm.de,"Page, Rachel/AAE-4816-2021; Hiller, Thomas/AAX-8786-2020; Page, Rachel/GQQ-2818-2022","Hiller, Thomas/0000-0003-4044-9956; Brandel, Stefan/0000-0002-7024-6386; Tschapka, Marco/0000-0001-9511-6775; Page, Rachel/0000-0001-7072-0669","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SPP 1596, TS 81/6-1]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: SPP 1596 Grant TS 81/6-1",,106,13,15,5,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0006-3606,1744-7429,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,MAY,2020,52,3,,,,,488,501,,10.1111/btp.12757,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.12757,,FEB 2020,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LQ6RA,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2025-02-11,WOS:000510463100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, many biological systems challenge this competitive exclusion principle. Insectivorous bats from the Northern Hemisphere typically form local assemblages of multiple species sharing highly similar functional traits and pertaining to identical feeding guilds. Although their trophic niche can be accessed with unprecedented details using genetic identification of prey, the underlying mechanisms of resource partitioning remain vastly unexplored. Here, we studied the differential diet of three closely-related bat species of the genus Plecotus in sympatry and throughout their entire breeding season using DNA metabarcoding. Even at such a small geographic scale, we identified strong seasonal and spatial variation of their diet composition at both intra- and interspecific levels. Indeed, while the different bats fed on a distinct array of prey during spring, they showed higher trophic niche overlap during summer and fall, when all three species switched their hunting behaviour to feed on few temporarily abundant moths. By recovering 19 ecological traits for over 600 prey species, we further inferred that each bat species used different feeding grounds and hunting techniques, suggesting that niche partitioning was primarily habitat-driven. The two most-closely related bat species exhibited very distinct foraging habitat preferences, while the third, more distantly-related species was more generalist. These results highlight the need of temporally comprehensive samples to fully understand species coexistence, and that valuable information can be derived from the taxonomic identity of prey obtained by metabarcoding approaches.","[Andriollo, Tommy; Ruedi, Manuel] Nat Hist Museum Geneva, Dept Mammal & Ornithol, Route Malagnou 1,CP 6434, CH-1211 Geneva 6, Switzerland; [Andriollo, Tommy] Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, Sect Biol, Geneva, Switzerland; [Michaux, Johan R.] Univ Liege, Inst Bot B22, Lab Genet Conservat, Liege, Belgium; [Michaux, Johan R.] CIRAD, Agirs Unit, TA C 22 E, Campus Int Baillarguet, Montpellier 5, France",University of Geneva; University of Liege; CIRAD,"Andriollo, T (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum Geneva, Dept Mammal & Ornithol, Route Malagnou 1,CP 6434, CH-1211 Geneva 6, Switzerland.",tommy.andriollo@ville-ge.ch,"; Ruedi, Manuel/B-3320-2013","Andriollo, Tommy/0000-0003-3922-7475; Ruedi, Manuel/0000-0003-3283-7764",Direction Generale de l'Agriculture et de la Nature de l'Etat de Geneve; Fondation Ernst AMP; Lucie Schmidheiny,Direction Generale de l'Agriculture et de la Nature de l'Etat de Geneve; Fondation Ernst AMP; Lucie Schmidheiny,"We gratefully acknowledge the people who helped us with guano sampling (alphabetically): Lucie Cauwet, Janik Pralong, Carlos Rouco, Cyril Schonbachler, Emmanuel Tardy, Laurent Vallotton and Eric Verelst.

After examination of trait correlation patterns, we reduced the nine initial leaf traits to four traits, representative of three correlation groups: allometric traits (dry weight), functional traits (SLA and dry matter percentage) and Leaf Thickness. We analysed the variability of these four leaf traits at species and site level. We observed that between species variation (between 64.5 for SLA and 91% for LDMC) is higher than within species variation. Allowing a good congruency of species ranking assessed by spearman rank correlation () and a good reallocation of individuals to species by discriminant analysis. A site level variability (between 0.7% for Dry weight and 6.9% for SLA) was identified and environmental parameters (altitude, temperature, precipitation, nitrogen, pH) were considered as probable control factors. We found significant correlation between SLA, LDMC and the average minimum temperature (respectively r=0.87 and r=-0,9) and no correlation for the other traits or environmental parameters. Furthermore, we conclude that two leaf traits appear to be central in describing species: specific leaf area (SLA), percentage of dry matter (LDMC. While, SLA and LDMC are strongly correlated, LDMC appears to be less variable than SLA. According to our results the Dry Matter Content (or its reversal Leaf Water Content) appears the best leaf trait to be quantified for plant functional screening.

Here, we review the evolutionary history of bats and eared insects, focusing on the insect order Lepidoptera, and consider the evidence for antipredator adaptations and predator counter-adaptations. Ears evolved in a remarkable number of body locations across insects, with the original selection pressure for ears differing between groups. Although cause and effect are difficult to determine, correlations between hearing and life history strategies in moths provide evidence for how these two variables influence each other. We consider life history variables such as size, sex, circadian and seasonal activity patterns, geographic range and the composition of sympatric bat communities. We also review hypotheses on the neural basis for antipredator behaviours (such as evasive flight and sound production) in moths. It is assumed that these prey adaptations would select for counter-adaptations in predatory bats. We suggest two levels of support for classifying bat traits as counter-adaptations: traits that allow bats to eat more eared prey than expected based on their availability in the environment provide a low level of support for counter-adaptations, whereas traits that have no other plausible explanation for their origination and maintenance than capturing defended prey constitute a high level of support. Specific predator counter-adaptations include calling at frequencies outside the sensitivity range of most eared prey, changing the pattern and frequency of echolocation calls during prey pursuit, and quiet, or 'stealth', echolocation.","[ter Hofstede, Hannah M.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, 78 Coll St, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Ratcliffe, John M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada",Dartmouth College; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"ter Hofstede, HM (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, 78 Coll St, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.;Ratcliffe, JM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",hannah.ter.hofstede@dartmouth.edu; j.ratcliffe@utoronto.ca,,,Danish Research Council (FNU); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); National Geographic Society; University of Toronto; Dartmouth College,Danish Research Council (FNU)(Danish Natural Science Research CouncilDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); National Geographic Society(National Geographic Society); University of Toronto(University of Toronto); Dartmouth College,"The Danish Research Council (FNU), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the National Geographic Society, the University of Toronto and Dartmouth College have funded our research.",,221,78,84,11,212,COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

Functional and phylogenetic diversity have received much less attention, particularly for vertebrate taxa. There is still a limited understanding of how functional, phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity change in concert across large gradients of elevation. Here, we focused on the Himalaya-representing the largest elevational gradients in the world-to investigate the patterns of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in a bat assemblage. Combining field data on species occurrence, relative abundance, and functional traits with measures of phylogenetic diversity, we found that bat species richness and functional diversity declined at high elevation but phylogenetic diversity remained unchanged. At the lowest elevation, we observed low functional dispersion despite high species and functional richness, suggesting a niche packing mechanism. The decline in functional richness, dispersion, and divergence at the highest elevation is consistent with patterns observed due to environmental filtering. These patterns are driven by the absence of rhinolophid bats, four congeners with extreme trait values. Our data, some of the first on mammals from the Himalayan region, suggest that in bat assemblages with relatively high species diversity, phylogenetic diversity may not be a substitute to measure functional diversity.","[Chakravarty, Rohit; Voigt, Christian C.; Radchuk, Viktoriia] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, D-10315 Berlin, Germany; [Chakravarty, Rohit; Voigt, Christian C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Anim Behav, Berlin, Germany; [Mohan, Ram; Krishnan, Anand] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER Pune, Dept Biol, Pashan Rd, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Krishnan, Anand] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER Bhopal, Dept Biol Sci, Bhauri 462066, India",Leibniz Institut fur Zoo und Wildtierforschung; Free University of Berlin; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) Pune; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Bhopal,"Chakravarty, R (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, D-10315 Berlin, Germany.;Chakravarty, R (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Anim Behav, Berlin, Germany.",rohit.chakravarty77@gmail.com,"Radchuk, Viktoriia/C-6665-2013; Chakravarty, Rohit/GWM-8927-2022","Mohan, Ram/0000-0001-7294-4113; Radchuk, Viktoriia/0000-0003-3072-0095","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India; Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India [ECR/2017/001527]; Wildlife Acoustics Scientific Product Grant; Rufford Foundation; Elisabeth Kalko Foundation; Idea Wild","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India; Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India; Wildlife Acoustics Scientific Product Grant; Rufford Foundation; Elisabeth Kalko Foundation; Idea Wild","RC acknowledges doctoral scholarship support from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

Using this prediction, we selected six life history and ecological factors to use in a comparative analysis of longevity among 64 bat species. On average, the maximum recorded life span of a bat is 3.5 times greater than a non-flying placental mammal of similar size. Records of individuals surviving more than 30 years in the wild now exist for five species. Univariate and multivariate analyses of species data, as well as of phylogenetically independent contrasts obtained using a supertree of Chiroptera, reveal that bat life span significantly increases with hibernation, body mass and occasional cave use, but decreases with reproductive rate and is not influenced by diet, colony size or the source of the record. These results are largely consistent with extrinsic mortality risk acting as a determinant of bat longevity. Nevertheless, the strong association between life span and both reproductive rate and hibernation also suggests that bat longevity is strongly influenced by seasonal allocation of non-renewable resources to reproduction. We speculate that hibernation may provide a natural example of caloric restriction, which is known to increase longevity in other mammals.","Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",gw10@umail.umd.edu,"Munshi-South, Jason/A-3385-2009; Wilkinson, Gerald/E-4424-2011","Wilkinson, Gerald/0000-0001-7799-8444; Munshi-South, Jason/0000-0002-8067-4341",,,,,78,301,361,1,147,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1474-9718,1474-9726,,AGING CELL,Aging Cell,DEC,2002,1,2,,,,,124,131,,10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00020.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00020.x,,,8,Cell Biology; Geriatrics & Gerontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Cell Biology; Geriatrics & Gerontology,678YZ,12882342,hybrid,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000182895400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, knowledge about the interacting effects of the timing of drought and the development stage of the vegetation during the growing season is still scarce, thus limiting our ability to accurately predict forage quantity losses. To investigate plant community responses to drought seasonality (early-vs. late-season), we established a drought experiment in two permanent grasslands of the Swiss Jura Mountains that are used for forage production. We measured three plant functional traits, including two leaf traits related to plant economics (specific leaf area, SLA; leaf dry matter content, LDMC) and one hydraulic trait related to physiological function (predicted percentage loss of hydraulic conductance, PLCp), of the most abundant species, and plant above-ground biomass production. Plant species composition was also determined to calculate community-weighted mean (CWM) traits. First, we observed that CWM trait values strongly varied during the growing season. Second, we found that late-season drought had stronger effects on CWM trait values than early-season drought and that the plant hydraulic trait was the most variable functional trait. Using a structural equation model, we also showed that reduction in soil moisture had no direct impacts on above-ground biomass production. Instead, we observed that the drought-induced decrease in above-ground biomass production was mediated by a higher CWM PLCp (i.e. higher risk of hydraulic failure) and lower CWM SLA under drought. Change in CWM SLA in response to drought was the best predictor of community above-ground biomass production. Our findings reveal the importance of drought timing together with the plant trait responses to assess drought impacts on grassland biomass production and suggest that incorporating these factors into mechanistic models could considerably improve predictions of climate change impacts.","[Vitra, Amarante; Signarbieux, Constant; Lamacque, Lia; Buttler, Alexandre; Mariotte, Pierre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Vitra, Amarante; Signarbieux, Constant; Buttler, Alexandre; Mariotte, Pierre] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Site Lausanne,Case Postale 96, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Deleglise, Claire; Meisser, Marco] Agroscope, Grazing Syst Grp, Route Duillier 50, CH-1260 Nyon, Switzerland; [Deleglise, Claire] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Irstea, LESSEM, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Risch, Anita C.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Community Ecol, Zuercherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Lamacque, Lia] Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRA, PIAF, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Lamacque, Lia] ITEIPMAI, F-26740 Domaine De La Vesc, Montboucher Sur, France; [Delzon, Sylvain] Univ Bordeaux 1, UB, INRA, UMR BIOGECO, Bat B2,Ave Fac, F-33405 Talence, France; [Buttler, Alexandre] Univ Franche Comte, Lab Chronoenvironm, UMR CNRS 6249, UFR Sci & Tech, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; INRAE; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); INRAE; INRAE; Universite de Bordeaux; Universite de Franche-Comte","Vitra, A (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Vitra, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Site Lausanne,Case Postale 96, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",amarante.vitra@epfl.ch,"Delzon, Sylvain/R-9538-2018; Vitra, Amarante/AAZ-3717-2021; Signarbieux, Constant/C-6564-2015; Risch, Anita C./A-9836-2012; Mariotte, Pierre/G-4798-2011","Signarbieux, Constant/0000-0001-7780-5366; Deleglise, Claire/0000-0001-6119-8311; Risch, Anita C./0000-0003-0531-8336; Mariotte, Pierre/0000-0001-8570-8742; Vitra, Amarante/0000-0003-4943-1170",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [CR31I3_156282/1]; 'Investments for the Future' programme from the French National Agency for Research [ANR-10-EQPX-16]; Cluster of Excellence COTE (DEFI project) [ANR-10-LABX-45]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [CR31I3_156282] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); 'Investments for the Future' programme from the French National Agency for Research(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Cluster of Excellence COTE (DEFI project); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This study is part of the GrassAlt project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF), grant no CR31I3_156282/1.

Data on roosting habitat of northern bats (Myotis septentrionalis) is limited for eastern deciduous forest. We radiotracked 13 adult female and 2 adult male northern bats as they used 57 day roots in mixed mesophytic forest in northeastern Kentucky from 18 May to 5 August 1998. Northern bats used day roosts in 12 species of tress, with sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum) and shortleaf pine (pinus echinata) each comprising 29.8% (n = 17/57) of the roost trees, respectively. Colonies, >1 northern bat, were predominantly found in cavities of hardwood snags (44.2%, n = 19/43) or under the bark of shortleaf pine snags (32.6%, n = 14/43). Snags possessing sloughing bark with branches absent were more frequently used as roosting sites by northern bats (52.9%, n = 18/34) than any other stage class of snag. Solitary bats were primarily found roosting in cavities of living hardwood trees (92.9% n = 13/14). Roost trees of northern bats were not disturbed equally among topographic locations, with roosts more frequently situated on upper slopes (45.6%, n = 26) and midslopes (38.6%, n = 22) than on lower slopes (15.8%, n = 9). Mean population size of colonies appeared to decline as summer progressed, with pregnant females using the largest colonies ((x) over bar = 25.6 +/- 10.2 bats), lactating females using intermediate-sized colonies ((x) over bar = 13.5 +/- 2.98 bats), and post-lactating females using the smallest colonies ((x) over bar = 3.8 +/- 1.66 bats). These data suggest that forest management practices that sustain diversity in tree species, tree-size class (3.1-55.8 cm dbh), and snag-condition class (stages 3 and 4) are necessary to provide habitat for northern bats in mixed mesophytic forests.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Forestry, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; Univ Kentucky, Dept Forestry, Lexington, KY 40546 USA",University of Kentucky; University of Kentucky,"Univ Kentucky, Dept Forestry, Lexington, KY 40546 USA.",mlacki@pop.uky.edu,,,,,,,38,63,83,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-541X,1937-2817,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

We evaluated the relationship between six ecological traits of phyllostomid bats (body mass, trophic level, vertical foraging area, natural abundance in continuous forest, wing aspect ratio, and relative wing loading) and three measures of sensitivity to habitat fragmentation (species prevalence, change in abundance index, and nestedness ranking) in a fragmented forest in Los Chimalapas, Mexico. Ecological traits were obtained from 20 bat species for a period of 2 years, and their relationship with measures of sensitivity to fragmentation was analyzed using Generalized Linear Models. The analysis suggests that naturally non-abundant species (e. g., Salvin's Big-eyed Bat [Chiroderma salvini]) have a greater risk of population decline because of habitat fragmentation. In contrast, abundant species such as Jamaican Fruit-eating Bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) will likely be less affected.

The human IFN system and its functionality has already been largely characterized and studied in detail. However, the IFN systems of bats have only been marginally examined to date up until the recent developments of the Bat1k project which have now opened new opportunities in research by identifying six new bat genomes to possess novel genes that are likely associated with viral tolerance exhibited in bats. Interestingly, bats have been hypothesized to possess the ability to establish a host-virus relationship where despite being infected, they exhibit limited signs of disease and still retain the ability to transmit the disease into other susceptible hosts. Bats are one of the most abundant and widespread vertebrates on the planet and host many zoonotic viruses that are highly pathogenic to humans. Several genomics, immunological, and biological features are thought to underlie novel antiviral mechanisms of bats. This review aims to explore the bat IFN system and developments in its diverse IFN features, focusing mainly on the model species, the Australian black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), while also highlighting bat innate immunity as an exciting and fruitful area of research to understand their ability to control viral-mediated pathogenesis.","[Clayton, Emily; Munir, Muhammad] Univ Lancaster, Dept Biomed & Life Sci, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Munir, M (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Biomed & Life Sci, Lancaster, England.",muhammad.munir@lancaster.ac.uk,"Munir, Muhammad/T-4965-2019","Munir, Muhammad/0000-0003-4038-0370; Munir, Muhammad/0000-0002-7889-1398; Clayton, Emily/0000-0002-6840-1105","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/M008681/1, BBS/E/I/00001852]; British Council [172710323, 332228521]; BBSRC [BBS/E/I/00001852, BB/M008681/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); British Council(The British Council in India); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),Laboratory of Molecular Virology at the Lancaster University is funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (BB/M008681/1 and BBS/E/I/00001852) and the British Council (172710323 and 332228521).,,74,26,29,3,15,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2235-2988,,,FRONT CELL INFECT MI,Front.

While recent studies have provided novel insight into bat-flower interactions, there are gaps in knowledge regarding their geographic distribution, the role of floral traits in ensuring attractiveness and mechanical fit to bats, and details of the structure of interaction networks between plants and bats. Here, we review bat pollination in the Caatinga, the largest and most diverse Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in the Neotropics, and a global hotspot for this pollination system. The first records of bat pollination date back less than 20 years and were mostly confined to a small area in the eastern part of the Caatinga. Over the last two decades, bat pollination has been confirmed for 22 genera of flowering plants from 12 families, through both direct observations and pollen records. Recent investigations of the floral biology of bat-pollinated plant species have revealed the role of floral traits such as styliflory, fragrant nectar, as well as white and greenish flowers without reflection in the ultraviolet range. Batpollinated plants in the Caatinga interact with at least 11 bat species (6 species of opportunistic and 5 species of specialized nectarivores). We list here another 126 Caatinga plant species that potentially might be batpollinated and should be targeted in future investigations. The high potential incidence of bat pollination (4.8% of the estimated flora) seems to be a peculiar feature of the Caatinga. We emphasize the urgency to perform nocturnal forays that will help to understand how bat pollination systems evolved in dry forests. This is particularly important because, similar to many other dry forests, the Caatinga is particularly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance and there is currently a considerable risk that many plant species will be lost before their pollination biology is fully understood.","[Domingos-Melo, Arthur] Univ Pernambuco, Lab Ecol, Campus Petrolina, BR-56328900 Petrolina, Brazil; [Albuquerque-Lima, Sinzinando] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Bot, Programa Posgrad Biol Vegetal, BR-50670901 Recife, Brazil; [Diniz, Ugo Mendes] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Lopes, Ariadna Valentina; Machado, Isabel Cristina] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Bot, BR-50670901 Recife, Brazil",Universidade de Pernambuco (UPE); Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Technical University of Munich; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Domingos-Melo, A (corresponding author), Univ Pernambuco, Lab Ecol, Campus Petrolina, BR-56328900 Petrolina, Brazil.",arthurdom.melo@gmail.com,"Diniz, Ugo/AAF-1175-2019; Machado, Isabel/I-6935-2012; Lopes, Ariadna/E-8432-2010; Albuquerque-Lima, Sinzinando/C-6818-2019","Lopes, Ariadna Valentina/0000-0001-5750-5913; Albuquerque-Lima, Sinzinando/0000-0001-5808-8269","FACEPE (Foundation for the Support of Science and Technology of Pernambuco) [IBPG-1258-2.05/14, IBPG-0550-2.03/14, BCT-0085-2.03/19, DCR-0031-2.03/21, APQ-0226-2.03/21]; CNPq [311021/2014, 310508/2019-3, 459485/2014-8, 437424/2018-9, 567739/2008-2, 481755/2013-6, 308832/2014-0, 309505/2018-6]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil [88882.347732/2019-0, 001]",FACEPE (Foundation for the Support of Science and Technology of Pernambuco); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"This work was supported by FACEPE (Foundation for the Support of Science and Technology of Pernambuco) for funding the Research (IBPG-1258-2.05/14, IBPG-0550-2.03/14; BCT-0085-2.03/19; DCR-0031-2.03/21; APQ-0226-2.03/21) .

The cross-context variation in these behavioral tendencies, however, is rarely explored with animals in contexts associated with different locomotion modes. This study assessed the variation and repeatability in behavioral traits of bent-wing bats Miniopterus fuliginosus in southern Taiwan, and the effects of contextual settings associated with locomotion mode. The bats were sampled in the dry winter season, and their behaviors were measured in hole-board box (HB) and tunnel box (TB) tests, both suited for quadrupedal movements of the bats, and flight-tent (FT) tests that allowed for flying behaviors. The bats in the FT tests showed more interindividual and between-trial behavioral variation than those in the HB and TB tests. Nearly all of the behaviors in the TB and FT tests, but only half of those in the HB tests, showed medium to high repeatability. These repeatable behaviors were grouped into distinct behavioral traits of boldness, activity, and exploration, which were correlated to one another across contexts. In addition, we observed a consistently higher correlation between behavioral categories across the HB and TB contexts than between either of these contexts and the FT context. The results indicate consistent among-individual behavioral differences across time and contexts in wildly caught bent-wing bats. The findings of behavioral repeatability and cross-context correlations also indicate context-dependent variation and suggest that test devices which allow for flight behaviors, such as flight tents or cages, may provide a more suitable setting for measuring the behaviors and animal personalities of bats, particularly for those species that display less or little quadrupedal movements.","[Kuo, Yu-Jen; Lee, Ya-Fu; Kuo, Yen-Min; Tai, Yik Ling] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, Tainan 701, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Lee, YF (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",yafulee@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,"Lee, Ya-Fu/0000-0001-7411-9408","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST ), Taiwan [105-2311-B-006-006-MY3, 108-2311-B-006-003]","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST ), Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This study was supported through the grants (105-2311-B-006-006-MY3, 108-2311-B-006-003) to YFL by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST ), Taiwan.",,78,3,3,1,10,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2056-306X,,,ZOOL LETT,Zool.

Bats have longevity, dispersal capacity, and adaptability to synotropic environments, characteristics that may favor their role in maintaining the life cycle of parasites. Therefore, the objective of this study was to carry out a worldwide systematic review of the occurrence of Leishmania species in bats, as well as to identify associations between eating habits and the type of sample collected with the occurrence of the infection. Data were obtained from a bibliographic search for studies that used molecular methods to identify parasites, employing the keywords bats AND Leishmania and their synonyms. We found 68 original studies, of which 20 were included in this review. Most studies were conducted in Brazil (60 %) and only 10 % were conducted in Old World countries. In all, 48 bat species were recorded that hosted seven Leishmania species, resulting in 62 different host-parasite interactions, and the Leishmania infantum interaction with bat species presented higher frequency. There was no significant difference between Leishmania species richness, infection percentage, and type of sample analyzed, but in general, it is observed that the use of different biological samples seems to expand the possibility of parasite detection. The patterns observed here indicate that bats can become infected with a wide variety of Leishmania species and likely play an important role in maintaining the parasite's life cycle. Thus, we suggest that studies aimed at understanding the transmission cycle of leishmaniasis include the investigation of bats as potential hosts or reservoirs of Leishmania.","[de Souza, Nubia Nunes; Cruz, Dardiane Santos; Xavier, Emanuelle de Moura Santos; Queiroz, Lorena dos Reis Pereira; Vieira, Thallyta Maria] Univ Estadual Montes Claros, Post Grad Program Hlth Sci, BR-39401002 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Ursine, Renata Luiz] Fed Univ Jequitinhonha & Mucuri Valleys, Dept Biol Sci, BR-39100000 Diamantina, Brazil; [Falca, Luiz Alberto Dolabela; de Araujo, Walter Santos; Vieira, Thallyta Maria] Univ Estadual Montes Claros, Dept Biol Sci, BR-39401002 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Gontijo, Celia Maria Ferreira] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Res Ctr Rene Rachou, Res Grp Leishmaniasis, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Melo, Maria Norma] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Parasitol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros; Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri (UFVJM); Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros; Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"de Souza, NN (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Montes Claros, Post Grad Program Hlth Sci, BR-39401002 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil.",nubianunes1707@gmail.com,"Gontijo, Celia/AAU-7736-2020; Queiroz, Lorena/AAA-9494-2020; Souza, Núbia/JGE-4684-2023; VEIRA, THALLYTA/GOE-3828-2022; de Araújo, Walter/AAA-4606-2020; Falcão, Luiz/E-3234-2016","Falcao, Luiz/0000-0001-5268-684X; De Souza, Nubia/0000-0002-1607-021X",,,,,51,7,7,1,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0001-706X,1873-6254,,ACTA TROP,Acta Trop.,DEC,2023,248,,,,,,,,107025,10.1016/j.actatropica.2023.107025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2023.107025,,OCT 2023,9,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,W9KR7,37769863,,,,2025-02-11,WOS:001094750800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Location Mountain ranges in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Methods We compiled a dataset with the composition of phyllostomid bat assemblages at 32 forested sites, ranging from 60 m to 1,960 m a.s.l. We quantified how abundance and diversity changed along this elevational gradient, and assessed the capacity of each species to be present and abundant at each elevation, identifying traits that may influence that capacity. Results Abundance and species diversity declined markedly with increasing elevation. Tolerance to low temperatures, low habitat specialization and cave roosting facilitated success at higher elevations. Owing to trait filtering, and to changes in resource availability with elevation, assemblages were progressively dominated by a smaller number of mostly generalist species as elevation increased. Higher elevations harbour only a subset of the species that are present in the lowland forest, with no mountain specialized species. Main conclusions High mountains harbour phyllostomid assemblages that are impoverished subsets of those at lower elevations. Phyllostomids have a tropical origin and may thus have a low potential to adapt to montane forest environments, which possibly explains the observed climatic trait filtering. Habitat filtering is also important, keeping forest specialists mostly at lowest elevations. Protected areas in the Atlantic Forest are mostly limited to mountains. While these areas are clearly important to protect biodiversity, including phyllostomid assemblages, it is now critical to protect and restore the few remnants of lower elevation Atlantic Forest where higher productivity and resource levels, increased complexity of vertical structure, and fewer climatic constraints favour the success of a wider range of phyllostomid bat species of tropical origin.","[de Carvalho, William Douglas] Univ Fed Amapa, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade Trop, Macapa, AP, Brazil; [de Carvalho, William Douglas; Palmeirim, Jorge M.] Univ Lisbon, Dept Biol Anim, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Lisbon, Portugal; [de Carvalho, William Douglas; Esberard, Carlos E.

Therefore, it is integral to understand how species and assemblages will respond to this threat. Elevational gradients present a useful framework to measure potential changes to diversity due to climate change and human land use. Most studies focus on taxonomic diversity, and ignore functional diversity which provides a measure of the ecological roles of species within ecosystems. The aim of this study was to investigate taxonomic and functional diversity of as well as variation in assemblage structure of the insectivorous bat communities along the Mount Nimba elevational gradient. We predicted that both taxonomic and functional diversity would be negatively correlated with elevation, and that bat assemblages would show a nested pattern along the elevational gradient. Taxonomic diversity was calculated using species richness. Functional diversity of univariate and multivariate traits was calculated using two diversity indices: mean pairwise distance and mean nearest taxon distance. As predicted, species richness of bats was significantly negatively correlated with elevation. Functional diversity however, decreased significantly only at the highest elevation (and this may even be a sampling artifact given high human activities there in recent times). Contrary to predictions, metacommunity analyses revealed quasi-Gleasonian structuring of bat assemblages, indicating weak structuring forces along the elevational gradient. These results suggest that bat assemblages shifting in response to climate change along elevational gradients may change taxonomically but stay largely intact functionally.","[Reardon, Shannon; Schoeman, M.

However, studies considering the effects of different types of anthropogenic disturbance on the functional dimension of biodiversity in human-modified landscapes are rare. Here, we obtained data through an extensive review of peer-reviewed articles and compared 30 Neotropical bat assemblages in well-preserved primary forest and four different human-disturbed habitats in terms of their functional and taxonomic diversity. We found that disturbed habitats that are structurally less similar to primary forest (pasture, cropland, and early-stage secondary forest) were characterized by a lower functional and taxonomic diversity, as well as community-level functional uniqueness. These habitats generally retained fewer species that perform different ecological functions compared to higher-quality landscape matrices, such as agroforestry. According to functional trait composition, different bat ensembles respond differently to landscape change, negatively affecting mainly gleaning insectivorous bats in pasture, narrow-range species in cropland, and heavier animalivorous bats in secondary forest. Although our results highlight the importance of higher-quality matrix habitats to support elevated functional and taxonomic bat diversity, the conservation of bat species that perform different ecological functions in the mosaic of human-modified habitats also depends on the irreplaceable conservation value of well-preserved primary forests. Our study based on a pooled analysis of individual studies provides novel insights into the effects of different human-modified habitats on Neotropical bat assemblages.","[Farneda, Fabio Z.; Grelle, Carlos E., V] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Meyer, Christoph F.

The impacts of roads on terrestrial fauna has been well studied, however little is known of the impact of roads on insectivorous bats. Wildlife crossing structures (e.g. fauna underpasses) may reduce the barrier impacts of roads and improve connectivity across roads. Use of underpasses by wildlife likely varies among species depending on their movement behaviour. In this study, we investigated whether the flight patterns of insectivorous bats influenced their use of underpasses. We monitored bat activity under and above 6 open-span bridges, 6 box culverts and 6 unmitigated sites along a major highway in Australia. We used Poisson regression models within a Bayesian framework of inference to compare the activity of 12 hat species (grouped into three guilds based on their flight patterns: clutter-adapted, edge-adapted, and open-adapted species) under the structures, over the road above the structures, above unmitigated segments of the highway, and in the vegetation adjacent to the roads. Bats were less active above the road than they were in the surrounding vegetation or under bridges. Two of the three guilds (i.e. seven species) crossed the highway more under bridges than they did under culverts or by going over the road, which suggests that bridges may reduce barrier effects of the road better than culverts. Installing bridges instead of culverts may better reduce the impacts of roads on multiple insectivorous bats species with a single structure type.","[Bhardwaj, M.; Soanes, K.; Straka, T.

However, we have little understanding of the skin and fur bacterial microbiota on bats, or factors that influence the structure of these communities. The southwestern United States offers excellent sites for the study of external bat bacterial microbiota due to the diversity of bat species, the variety of abiotic and biotic factors that may govern bat bacterial microbiota communities, and the lack of the newly emergent fungal disease in bats, white-nose syndrome (WNS), in the southwest. To test these variables, we used 16S rRNA gene 454 pyrosequencing from swabs of external skin and fur surfaces from 163 bats from 13 species sampled from southeastern New Mexico to northwestern Arizona. Community similarity patterns, random forest models, and generalized linear mixed-effects models show that factors such as location (e.g., cave-caught versus surface-netted) and ecoregion are major contributors to the structure of bacterial communities on bats. Bats caught in caves had a distinct microbial community compared to those that were netted on the surface. Our results provide a first insight into the distribution of skin and fur bat bacteria in the WNS-free environment of New Mexico and Arizona. More importantly, it provides a baseline of bat external microbiota that can be explored for potential natural defenses against pathogens.","[Winter, Ara S.; Hathaway, Jennifer J.

In the last decades, more than half of the Cerrado area has been converted by agriculture and livestock production, leading to a significant loss of its natural vegetation. Here we evaluated changes in bat diversity between varying agricultural land use intensity levels and phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado. Because processes behind the patterns of community assembly act on ecological redundancies and complementarities of organisms and not only, or necessarily, on the number of species present in a certain region, we focused on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of bats. We predicted that all three dimensions of bat diversity were negatively correlated with increasing levels of land-use intensity in the Cerrado, and that this pattern was mirrored in distinct phytophysiognomies of the domain. We sampled bats in the central Brazilian Cerrado using a comprehensive sampling scheme of mist-nets and automated real-time ultrasound-recording units in 27 sampling points covering different physiognomies and levels of land-use modification for two consecutive years. To our knowledge our sampling was unique in combining these two techniques, returning information on close-, edge- and open-space foraging guilds, rarely all sampled in Neotropical bat studies. A remarkable total of 64 species of six families were registered in the study area. In general no statistical differences were found in any of the diversity metrics between the sampled physiognomies, but a decrease in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity was observed in all physiognomies associated with land use intensification and this was consistent across guilds. This demonstrates the potential negative impact of land use intensification in ecosystem services provided by bats, including pollination, seed dispersal and insect control.","[Ramos Pereira, Maria Joao] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Lab Evolucao Sistemat & Ecol Aves & Mamiferos, Av Bento Goncalves 9500,Campus Vale, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Ramos Pereira, Maria Joao; Fonseca, Carlos] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Estudos Ambiente & Mar, Dept Biol, Unidade Vida Selvagem, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Aguiar, Ludmilla M.

Therefore, chiropterophilous plants, which depend on these bats as pollinators, may be expected to have evolved acoustically conspicuous flowers that facilitate detection. As it is poorly understood how bats manage to find and recognize flowers acoustically, we investigated the echoes of some of the flowers pollinated by bats. Echoes of bell-shaped bat-pollinated flowers have characteristic features with respect to the echoes they reflect to a calling bat and differ from the echoes of leaves or other objects in their surroundings: the echoes are comparatively long and of complex spectral composition. Owing to the specific shape of the flowers, characteristic 'spectral directional patterns' result when the spectra of the echoes are plotted against the angle of sound incidence. We suggest that bats are able to recognize such flowers - and probably other objects as well - not only by a characteristic spectral composition of the echo but also by comparing sequential echoes, at the same time taking into account their exact calling position relative to the object.","Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Zool, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Max Planck Inst Verhaltensphysiol, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany.",dghelv@biologie.uni-erlangen.de,"Holderied, Marc/M-9382-2013","Holderied, Marc/0000-0002-1573-7908",,,,,37,48,55,0,44,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

They fill an important ecological niche and have diversified into a wide range of habitats. In recent years, bats have been implicated as reservoirs for some of the most highly pathogenic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases reported to date, including SARS-like coronavirus, Ebola, Hendra and Nipah viruses. The ability of bats to harbour these viruses in the absence of clinical signs of disease has resulted in a resurgence of interest in bat biology and virus-host interactions. Interest in bats, in Australia in particular, has intensified following the identification of several novel bat-borne viruses from flying-foxes, including Hendra virus, which is capable of spillover from bats to horses and subsequently to humans with potentially fatal consequences. As we continue to encroach on the natural habitats of bats, a better understanding of bat biology, ecology and virus-host interactions has never before been so critical. In this review, we focus on the biology of Australian pteropid bats and the pathogens they harbour, summarising current knowledge of bat-borne diseases, bat ecology, ethology and immunology.","[Ng, Justin H.

Bats were sampled on 11 islands and the adjacent mainland in Panama, and in eight forest fragments and nearby continuous forest in Brazil. Species-area relationships (SAR) were assessed based on Chao1 species richness estimates, and functional diversity-area relationships (FAR) were quantified using Chao1 functional diversity estimates measured as the total branch length of a trait dendrogram. FARs were calculated using three trait sets: considering five species functional traits (FAR(ALL)), and trait subsets reflecting 'diet breadth' (FAR(DIET)) and 'dispersal ability' (FAR(DISPERSAL)). We found that in both study systems, FAR(ALL) was less sensitive to habitat loss than SAR, in the sense that an equal reduction in habitat loss led to a disproportionately smaller loss of functional diversity compared to species richness. However, the inhospitable and static aquatic matrix in the island ecosystem resulted in more pronounced species loss with increasing loss of habitat compared to the countryside ecosystem. Moreover, while we found a significant FAR(DISPERSAL) for the island ecosystem in relation to forest cover within 500 m landscape buffers, FAR(DIET) and FAR(DISPERSAL) were not significant for the countryside ecosystem. Our findings highlight that species richness and functional diversity in island and countryside ecosystems scale fundamentally differently with habitat loss, and suggest that key bat ecological functions, such as pollination, seed dispersal and arthropod suppression, may be maintained in fragments despite a reduction in species richness. Our study reinforces the importance of increasing habitat availability for decreasing the chances of losing species richness in smaller fragments.","[Farneda, Fabio Z.; Grelle, Carlos E.

Until now, however, bats have been conspicuously absent from the early Eocene of mainland Asia. Here, we report two teeth from the Junggar Basin of northern Xinjiang, China belonging to the first known early Eocene bats from Asia, representing arguably the most plesiomorphic bat molars currently recognized. These teeth combine certain bat synapomorphies with primitive traits found in other placental mammals, thereby potentially illuminating dental evolution among stem bats. The Junggar Basin teeth suggest that the dentition of the stem chiropteran family Onychonycteridae is surprisingly derived, although their postcranial anatomy is more primitive than that of any other Eocene bats. Additional comparisons with stem bat families Icaronycteridae and Archaeonycteridae fail to identify unambiguous synapomorphies for the latter taxa, raising the possibility that neither is monophyletic as currently recognized. The presence of highly plesiomorphic bats in the early Eocene of central Asia suggests that this region was an important locus for the earliest, transitional phases of bat evolution, as has been demonstrated for other placental mammal orders including Lagomorpha and Rodentia.","[Jones, Matthew F.; Beard, K.

For example, bats assume a wide variety of foraging strategies, dietary traits, different flight abilities, and New World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are among the most functionally diverse family of bats. Nonetheless, this variation remains uncharacterized in Honduras. Our study investigated the relationship of environmental and climatic variables that influence leaf-nosed bat assemblages in terms of alpha and beta taxonomic and functional diversity. From February 2015 to May 2019, we sampled 56 sites and captured 1086 phyllostomid bats. We found that taxonomic alpha diversity decreased with elevation, and that functional alpha diversity decreased with elevation and humidity. Changes in taxonomic beta-diversity were associated with elevation and changes in functional beta-diversity were associated with humidity, elevation, and precipitation. Our findings suggest that elevation is the key environmental variable influencing New World leaf-nosed bat assemblages in Honduras, and even though species composition varies among different habitats, the functional composition of assemblages remains similar.","[Turcios-Casco, Manfredo A.] Inst Nacl Conservac & Desarrollo Forestal, Areas Protegidas & Vida Silvestre ICF, Reg Forestal Francisco Morazan, Tegucigalpa, Honduras; [Turcios-Casco, Manfredo A.; Caceres, Nilton; de Sales Dambros, Cristian] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Ecol & Evolucao, Ctr Ciencias Nat & Exatas, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Turcios-Casco, Manfredo A.; Gatti, Roberto Cazzolla] Tomsk State Univ TSU, Biol Inst, Lenin Ave 36, Tomsk, Russia; [Gatti, Roberto Cazzolla] Konrad Lorenz Inst Evolut & Cognit Res, Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Dri, Gabriela Franzoi] Univ Maine, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Conservat Biol, 5755 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Stevens, Richard] Museum Texas Tech Univ, Dept Nat Resources Management, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Stevens, Richard] Museum Texas Tech Univ, Nat Sci Res Lab, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Tomsk State University; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Turcios-Casco, MA (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Conservac & Desarrollo Forestal, Areas Protegidas & Vida Silvestre ICF, Reg Forestal Francisco Morazan, Tegucigalpa, Honduras.;Turcios-Casco, MA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Ecol & Evolucao, Ctr Ciencias Nat & Exatas, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.;Turcios-Casco, MA (corresponding author), Tomsk State Univ TSU, Biol Inst, Lenin Ave 36, Tomsk, Russia.",manturcios21@gmail.com,"Casco, Manfredo/Y-2693-2019; Cazzolla Gatti, Roberto/ABD-7380-2021; Cazzolla Gatti, Roberto/G-5462-2015; Dambros, Cristian/B-5521-2013; Caceres, Nilton/H-6899-2012","Cazzolla Gatti, Roberto/0000-0001-5130-8492; Dri, Gabriela/0000-0003-2528-409X; Dambros, Cristian/0000-0002-5781-7471; Turcios, Manfredo/0000-0002-3198-3834; Caceres, Nilton/0000-0003-4904-0604; Stevens, Richard/0000-0002-9821-0633",,,,,82,2,2,2,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1616-5047,1618-1476,,MAMM BIOL,Mamm.

In particular, insectivorous bats play an important role in the epidemiology of rabies and some rabies-like viruses, while the haematophagous vampire bats are the major wildlife vector for rabies in Latin America. in contrast, the role of fruit bats (flying foxes) in the epidemiology of the recently discovered Australian bat lyssavirus is only just emerging. Information on the pathogenesis of lyssaviruses in bats is scarce. However, in general, mortality in bats infected via a natural route appears to be low, and seroconversion occurs in many of those that survive. While transmission of rabies from an infected bat may be via a bite, other routes are apparently also possible. Methods for the diagnosis of bat lyssavirus infections in bats and terrestrial mammals (including humans) are similar to the classical procedures for rabies. Measures for the prevention and control of these diseases are also similar to those for rabies, although additional innovative methods have been tested, specifically to control vampire bat rabies.","CSIRO, Australian Anim Hlth Lab, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia; Inst Pasteur, Lab Lyssavirus, F-75724 Paris, France; Inst Mexicano Seguro Social, Unidad Invest Med & Immunol, Mexico City 03020, DF, Mexico",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Pasteur Network; Universite Paris Cite; Institut Pasteur Paris; Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,"CSIRO, Australian Anim Hlth Lab, POB 24, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia.",,"TORDO, Noël/GQQ-9089-2022","Alvaro, Aguilar Setien/0000-0003-1339-2931",,,,,130,59,68,2,47,OFFICE INT EPIZOOTIES,PARIS,"12 RUE DE PRONY, 75017 PARIS, FRANCE",0253-1933,1608-0637,,REV SCI TECH OIE,Rev.

Knowledge of the genetic basis of limb organogenesis in bats has increased but little has been documented regarding the differences between limb organogenesis in bats and that of other vertebrates. We conducted embryological comparisons of the timelines of limb organogenesis in 24 bat species and 72 non-bat amniotes. In bats, the time invested for forelimb organogenesis has been considerably extended and the appearance timing of the forelimb ridge has been significantly accelerated, whereas the timing of the finger and first appearance of the claw development has been delayed, facilitating the enlargement of the manus. Furthermore, we discovered that bats initiate the development of their hindlimbs earlier than their forelimbs compared with other placentals. Bat neonates are known to be able to cling continuously with their well-developed foot to the maternal bodies or habitat substrates soon after birth. We suggest that this unique life history of neonates, which possibly coevolved with powered flight, has driven the accelerated development of the hindlimb and precocious foot.","[Nojiri, Taro; Takechi, Masaki; Furutera, Toshiko] Juntendo Univ, Grad Sch Med, 2-1-1,Hongo,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; [Nojiri, Taro] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, North 11,West 10, Sapporo 0600811, Japan; [Nojiri, Taro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 1-1-1,Yayoi,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Werneburg, Ingmar] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Palaeoenvironm, Sigwartstr 10, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Werneburg, Ingmar] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Fachbereich Geowissensch, Holderlinstr 12, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Tu, Vuong Tan] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Inst Ecol & Biol Resources, 18 Hoang Quoc Viet Rd, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Tu, Vuong Tan] Grad Univ Sci & Technol, Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, 18 Hoang Quac Viet Rd, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Fukui, Dai] Univ Tokyo, Univ Tokyo Hokkaido Forest, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 9-61 Yamabe Higashimachi, Furano, Hokkaido 0791563, Japan; [Takechi, Masaki; Iseki, Sachiko; Furutera, Toshiko; Koyabu, Daisuke] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Mol Craniofacial Embryol, 1-5-45 Yushima,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Koyabu, Daisuke] Univ Tsukuba, Res & Dev Ctr Precis Med, 1-2 Kasuga, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058550, Japan",Juntendo University; Hokkaido University; University of Tokyo; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Leibniz Association; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); University of Tokyo; Institute of Science Tokyo; Tokyo Medical & Dental University (TMDU); University of Tsukuba,"Nojiri, T (corresponding author), Juntendo Univ, Grad Sch Med, 2-1-1,Hongo,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138421, Japan.;Nojiri, T (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, North 11,West 10, Sapporo 0600811, Japan.;Nojiri, T (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 1-1-1,Yayoi,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.;Koyabu, D (corresponding author), Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Mol Craniofacial Embryol, 1-5-45 Yushima,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan.;Koyabu, D (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Res & Dev Ctr Precis Med, 1-2 Kasuga, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058550, Japan.",nojiri0805@gmail.com; dsk8evoluxion@gmail.com,"Tu, Vuong/HZH-9935-2023; Werneburg, Ingmar/AGN-1309-2022; Nojiri, Taro/IWU-6097-2023; Koyabu, Daisuke/AAL-4116-2020; Fukui, Dai/D-6100-2013","Nojiri, Taro/0000-0002-9984-3467; Fukui, Dai/0000-0002-5449-4283; Werneburg, Ingmar/0000-0003-1359-2036; Koyabu, Daisuke/0000-0002-4087-7742","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21K19291, 22KJ2744, 21H02546] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,100,5,5,4,14,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The small insectivorous orange-bellied bat, Lampronycteris brachyotis (Phyllostomidae), differs from coexisting gleaners in key ecomorphological characteristics, including longer, narrower wings and smaller ears. Using telemetry, we measured range size, range use, and activity patterns, and assessed habitat preferences for 9 individuals for 50 nights over 4 months on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The bats spent the night in individual, medium-sized (22-27 ha) foraging areas within forested regions close to shorelines, up to 4 km away from the day roost. Each bat spent most of its time in a small (3-5 ha) core area. Foraging flights ranged from a few s to more than 70 min. Total flight time per night averaged 3.5 h and flight distance was estimated to be 60 km. There were no distinct activity peaks. Our tracking data suggest that L. brachyotis primarily forages in the canopy, where it gleans insects from vegetation in a combination of perch hunting and continuous flight. This species may also catch insects in air above the canopy. This unique behaviour among gleaning insectivorous phyllostomids corroborates our hypothesis that morphological adaptations combined with behavioural flexibility reflect distinct differences in foraging strategies and microhabitat selection. We conclude that differential use of space and hunting strategies promotes coexistence among the species-rich guild of Neotropical insectivorous gleaning bats.","Univ Ulm, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama",Ulm University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Univ Ulm, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89069 Ulm, Germany.",elisabeth.kalko@biologie.uni-ulm.de,,,,,,,58,31,36,2,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

Bats can be found in almost all global habitats with the notable exception of the high arctic and a few isolated oceanic islands. First, we give an overview on the potential role of bats as carriers of zoonotic viruses, underlining the relevance of specific physiological traits of representatives of this mammalian order, that are supporting the transmission of these disease agents. Research in this field was predominantly initiated by the SARS coronavirus event in 2003, and in the meantime, bats are assumed to be the ancestor hosts for numerous alpha and beta coronaviruses. Bat associated coronaviruses have been detected on all continents where bats are distributed. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, coronavirus research has again been considerably intensified, leading to a gain of knowledge regarding the interaction between bats and coronaviruses that will be valuable in the management of potential future outbreaks originating from bats. Finally, an outlook is given on research gaps that could be invaluable when dealing with future pandemic events.","[Bokelmann, Marcel; Balkema-Buschmann, Anne] Friedrich Loeffler Inst, Inst Novel & Emerging Infect Dis, Sudufer 10, D-17493 Greifswald, Germany",Friedrich Loeffler Institute,"Balkema-Buschmann, A (corresponding author), Friedrich Loeffler Inst, Inst Novel & Emerging Infect Dis, Sudufer 10, D-17493 Greifswald, Germany.",Anne.Balkema-Buschmann@fli.de,,"Balkema-Buschmann, Anne/0000-0001-7613-9592",,,,,139,4,4,1,14,SCHLUETERSCHE VERLAGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH & CO KG,HANNOVER,"HANS-BOCKLER-ALLEE 7, 30173 HANNOVER, GERMANY",0005-9366,1439-0299,,BERL MUNCH TIERARZTL,Berliner Munchener Tierarztl.

Here, species of bats and bat flies were identified and screened for microorganisms that could be mediated by bat flies. Methods Bat species were identified on the basis of their morphological characteristics. Bat flies associated with bat species were initially morphologically identified and further identified at the genus level by analyzing the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene. Different vector-borne pathogens and endosymbionts were screened using PCR to assess all possible relationships among bats, parasitic bat flies, and their associated organisms. Results Seventy-four bat flies were collected from 198 bats; 66 of these belonged to Nycteribiidae and eight to Streblidae families. All Streblidae bat flies were hosted by Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, known as the most common Korean bat. Among the 74 tested bat flies, PCR and nucleotide sequencing data showed that 35 (47.3%) and 20 (27.0%) carried Wolbachia and Bartonella bacteria, respectively, whereas tests for Anaplasma, Borrelia, Hepatozoon, Babesia, Theileria, and Coxiella were negative. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Wolbachia endosymbionts belonged to two different supergroups, A and F. One sequence of Bartonella was identical to that of Bartonella isolated from Taiwanese bats. Conclusions The vectorial role of bat flies should be checked by testing the same pathogen and bacterial organisms by collecting blood from host bats. This study is of great interest in the fields of disease ecology and public health owing to the bats' potential to transmit pathogens to humans and/or livestock.","[Lee, Haeseung; Kwon, Oh-Deog; Kwak, Dongmi] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Coll Vet Med, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea; [Seo, Min-Goo] Anim & Plant Quarantine Agcy, Vet Drugs & Biol Div, 177 Hyeoksin 8 Ro, Gimcheon 39660, Gyeongbuk, South Korea; [Lee, Seung-Hun] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Coll Vet Med, 1 Chungdae Ro, Cheongju 28644, Chungbuk, South Korea; [Oem, Jae-Ku] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Coll Vet Med, 79 Gobong Ro, Iksan 54596, Jeonbuk, South Korea; [Kim, Seon-Hee; Jeong, Hyesung; Kim, Yongkwan; Jheong, Weon-Hwa] Natl Inst Wildlife Dis Control & Prevent, 1 Songam Gil, Gwangju 62407, South Korea",Kyungpook National University (KNU); Animal & Plant Quarantine Agency; Chungbuk National University; Jeonbuk National University,"Kwak, D (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Coll Vet Med, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea.",dmkwak@knu.ac.kr,"Kim, Yong-kwan/LIC-0165-2024","Kwak, Dongmi/0000-0003-0876-3179; Seo, Min-Goo/0000-0003-1752-5105; Lee, Seung-Hun/0000-0002-6244-0381","National Institute of Environmental Research in the Ministry of Environment, Korea [NIER-2019-01-01-006]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Education [NRF-2016R1D1A1B02015366]","National Institute of Environmental Research in the Ministry of Environment, Korea; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Education","This work was partially supported by grants from the National Institute of Environmental Research (grant number NIER-2019-01-01-006) in the Ministry of Environment, Korea, and from the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education (grant number NRF-2016R1D1A1B02015366).

Consequently, they often interact with fire. Previous reviews of the effects of fire on bats have focused on prescribed fire effects, in part due to the limited number of studies on bat responses to wildfire. However, over the past several years, studies on bat responses to wildfire and prescribed fire have increased considerably. We reviewed this rapidly expanding body of literature to determine whether bats respond differently to prescribed fire and wildfire, and the important factors driving those differences. We also examined regional similarities and differences in bat response to prescribed fire and wildfire and identified areas in need of further research. Results Our review included 52 studies (29 prescribed fire, 23 wildfire) from North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Africa, although studies from Europe, South America, and Africa were limited. In general, we found that bats show positive or neutral responses to prescribed fire, whereas a greater proportion of negative responses were reported for wildfire. However, some of the negative responses to wildfire are short-lived or local, suggesting that bats may be resilient to the effects of fire. Factors such as fire severity, fire frequency, time since last burn, burn extent, season of burn, and pyrodiversity were all found to be important drivers of bats' responses to both prescribed fire and wildfire. Conclusions The importance of the spatial and temporal aspects of fire suggests that these factors need to be considered when designing future studies and interpreting results. Pyrodiversity may be a particularly important concept to further our understanding of bats' responses to fire. We found several gaps in our knowledge including lack of information on direct effects of fire (e.g., mortality), regional and taxonomic biases, effects of wildfire on roosting habitat, and the effects of climate change. Although current studies suggest that fire may be an important management tool for improving bat habitat, the threat of more frequent, extensive, and severe wildfires may put additional stress on some bat populations, particularly those being impacted by disease, habitat loss and fragmentation, and climate change.","[Loeb, Susan C.] Clemson Univ, US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 233 Lehotsky Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Blakey, Rachel, V] Univ Calif Los Angeles, La Kretz Ctr Calif Conservat Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Clemson University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Loeb, SC (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 233 Lehotsky Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",susan.loeb@usda.gov,"Blakey, Rachel/AAD-9772-2019","Blakey, Rachel/0000-0002-6654-5703; Loeb, Susan/0000-0002-9264-3614","U.S. Forest Service, Southern Research Station; La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science at the University of California, Los Angeles","U.S. Forest Service, Southern Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science at the University of California, Los Angeles","S.

Small non-volant mammals occupy the fast/high end in both continua with high reproductive rates and short life spans linked with high mass-specific metabolic rates. Bats occupy the high end of the metabolic continuum, but the slow end of the life-history continuum with low reproductive rates and long life spans. Typically, both continua are linked, and similar life-history traits of species are reflected in more similar metabolic rates. We therefore hypothesized that metabolic rates are similar in species with similar life-history traits. Resting metabolic rates (RMR) were measured for three ecologically and morphologically similar sympatric bat species (Myotis nattereri, M. bechsteinii, and Plecotus auritus; Vespertilionidae) and compared to data from other similar-sized, temperate insectivorous mammals with other life-history strategies. The bat species share similar life-histories and RMRs, both of which differ from the remaining mammals and therefore supporting our hypothesis. To verify that bats are similar in RMR, two energetically contrasting periods were compared. RMRs in post-lactating females did not differ between bat species. It was, however, positively correlated with parasite load in both Myotis species. However, RMRs differed during energy-demanding pregnancy where M. nattereri had the significantly lowest RMR, suggesting metabolic compensation as an energy-saving strategy. We conclude that the energy requirements of bat species with similar life-history traits resemble each other during periods of low energetic demands and are more similar to each other than to other small temperate mammals.","[Becker, N.

Current data reveal a multifaceted disease ecology where diverse host species distributed around the world interact with a number of Bartonella spp. and several potential vectors. This review summarizes the methods and findings of studies conducted since 2005 to illustrate that Bartonella bacteremia varies by bat species, location, and other potential variables, such as diet with a very high prevalence in hematophagous bats. Among bat families, Bartonella prevalence ranged from 7.3% among Nycteridae to 54.4% in Miniopteridae.

By its harmonized structure, and the diversity of ecosystem types, taxonomic groups, and spatial scales it covers, the CESTES database provides an important opportunity for synthetic trait-based research in community ecology.","[Jeliazkov, Alienor; Mijatovic, Darko; van Klink, Roel; Chase, Jonathan M.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5E, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Jeliazkov, Alienor; Chase, Jonathan M.] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Comp Sci, D-06099 Halle, Salle, Germany; [Chantepie, Stephane] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Andrew, Nigel] Univ New England, Zool, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Arlettaz, Raphael; Humbert, Jean-Yves] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Barbaro, Luc] Univ Toulouse, Dynafor, INRA INPT, Auzeville, France; [Barbaro, Luc; Le Saux, Eric; Pavoine, Sandrine] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat CESCO, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Paris, France; [Barsoum, Nadia] Ctr Ecosyst Soc & Biosecur, Forest Res, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England; [Bartonova, Alena] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Biol Ctr CAS, Branisovska 31, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Bartonova, Alena] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Sci, Branisovska 1760, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Belskaya, Elena; Zolotarev, Maxim] Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol, Eighth March St 202, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia; [Bonada, Nuria] Univ Barcelona, Grp Recerca Freshwater Ecol Hydrol & Management F, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio,Fac Biol, Diagonal 643, E-08028 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Brind'Amour, Anik] IFREMER, Unite Ecol & Modeles Halieut, Rue Ile Yeu,BP 21105, F-44311 Nantes 03, France; [Carvalho, Rodrigo] Univ Estadual Goias, Dept Biol, Campus Palmeiras de Goias, Palmeiras De Goias, Go, Brazil; [Carvalho, Rodrigo] Univ Estadual Goias, Programa Posgrad Recursos Nat Cerrado RENAC, Campus Ciencias Exatas & Tecnol Henrique Santillo, BR-75132400 Anapolis, Go, Brazil; [Castro, Helena] Univ Coimbra, CFE Ctr Funct Ecol Sci People & Planet, Dept Life Sci, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal; [Chmura, Damian; Zarnowiec, Jan] Univ Bielsko Biala, Inst Environm Protect & Engn, Willowa 2, PL-43309 Bielsko Biala, Poland; [Choler, Philippe] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, LECA, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Chong-Seng, Karen] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Cleary, Daniel] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Cleary, Daniel] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Cleary, Daniel] Natl Penghu Univ Sci & Technol, Trop Isl Sustainable Dev Res Ctr, 300 Liu Ho Rd, Magong 880, Penghu, Taiwan; [Cormont, Anouk; Wegman, Ruut] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res, Droevendaalsesteeg 3-3 A, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Cornwell, William] UNSW Sydney, Ecol & Evolut Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [de Campos, Ramiro; Higuti, Janet] Univ Estadual Maringa, Programa Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Nucleo Pesquisas Limnol, Ictiol, Ave Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [de Voogd, Nicole; Renema, Willem] Nat Biodivers Ctr, Marine Biodivers, Vondellaan 55, NL-2332 AA Leiden, Netherlands; [de Voogd, Nicole] Leiden Univ, Dept Environm Biol, Inst Environm Sci, Einsteinweg 2, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands; [Doledec, Sylvain] Univ Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, UMR 5023 LEHNA, Villeurbanne, France; [Drew, Joshua] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Dziock, Frank] Univ Appl Sci HTW Dresden, Pillnitzer Pl 2, D-01326 Dresden, Germany; [Eallonardo, Anthony] OBG, 400 Andrews St,Suite 710, Rochester, NY 14604 USA; [Edgar, Melanie J.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England; [Farneda, Fabio] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Farneda, Fabio; Lopez-Baucells, Adria; Meyer, Christoph F.

Here, we review and qualitatively describe trends in the occurrence and apparent causes of multiple mortality events (MMEs) in bats around the world. We compiled a database of MMEs, defined as cases in which10 dead bats were counted or estimated at a specific location within a maximum timescale of a year, and more typically within a few days or a season. We tabulated 1180 MMEs within nine categories. Prior to 2000, intentional killing by humans caused the greatest proportion of MMEs in bats. In North America and Europe, people typically killed bats because they were perceived as nuisances. Intentional killing occurred in South America for vampire bat control, in Asia and Australia for fruit depredation control, and in Africa and Asia for human food. Biotic factors, accidents, and natural abiotic factors were also important historically. Chemical contaminants were confirmed causes of MMEs in North America, Europe, and in islands. Viral and bacterial diseases ranked low as causes of MMEs in bats. Two factors led to a major shift in causes of MMEs in bats at around 2000: the global increase of industrial wind-power facilities and the outbreak of white-nose syndrome in North America. Collisions with wind turbines and white-nose syndrome are now the leading causes of reported MMEs in bats. Collectively, over half of all reported MMEs were of anthropogenic origin. The documented occurrence of MMEs in bats due to abiotic factors such as intense storms, flooding, heat waves, and drought is likely to increase in the future with climate change. Coupled with the chronic threats of roosting and foraging habitat loss, increasing mortality through MMEs is unlikely to be compensated for, given the need for high survival in the dynamics of bat populations.","[O'Shea, Thomas J.; Cryan, Paul M.] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Hayman, David T.

We compared pollinator effectiveness between facultative and obligate nectar-feeding bats to determine how foraging specialization influences mutualistic interactions in a bat-adapted cactus. We predicted that a specialized nectarivorous bat would deliver more pollen than an opportunistic nectar-feeding bat because of specialized adaptations to nectar feeding that indicate close association with their food plants. Counter to our predictions, the opportunistic Antrozous pallidus delivered significantly more pollen grains per visit than the specialized Leptonycteris yerbabuenae. Higher pollinator effectiveness, based on visitation rates and pollen deposition levels, varied between species by site, and although A. pallidus visits flowers much less frequently than L. yerbabuenae over all sites, it is likely an effective and reliable pollinator of Pachycereus pringlei in Baja, Mexico. Our results suggest that morphological adaptations and dietary specialization on nectar do not necessarily confer advantages for pollination over less specialized plant visitors and highlight the reciprocally exploitative nature of mutualisms.","[Frick, Winifred F.; Kay, Kathleen M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Price, Ryan D.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Heady, Paul A., III] Cent Coast Bat Res Grp, Aptos, CA 95001 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Frick, WF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",wfrick@ucsc.edu,"Frick, Winifred/ABA-3519-2020; Kay, Kathleen/AAT-2250-2021","Kay, Kathleen/0000-0001-8858-110X","University of California Institute for Mexico; United States Faculty Grant; Mildred Mathias Award; Central Coast Bat Research Group; National Science Foundation [DBI-0905881, DEB-1115895]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1336290] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",University of California Institute for Mexico; United States Faculty Grant; Mildred Mathias Award; Central Coast Bat Research Group; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We particularly thank S.

Here, we studied 105 bat species from 19 families using histology, iodine-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and/or micro-CT. We focused on structural elements that support a functional peripheral vomeronasal receptor organ (vomeronasal organ [VNO]), together comprising the vomeronasal complex. Our results support prior studies that describe a functional VNO in most phyllostomid bats, miniopterids, and some mormoopids (most known Pteronotus spp.). All of these species (or congeners, at least) have vomeronasal nerves connecting the VNO with the brain and some intact genes related to a functional VNO. However, some bats have VNOs that lack a neuroepithelium and yet still possess elements that aid VNO function, such as a capsular morphology of the vomeronasal cartilages (VNCs), and even large venous sinuses, which together facilitate a vasomotor pump mechanism that can draw fluid into the VNO. We also show that ostensibly functionless VNOs of some bats are developmentally associated with ganglionic masses, perhaps involved in endocrine pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that the capsular VNC articulates with the premaxilla or maxilla, and that these bones bear visible grooves denoting the location of the VNC. Since these paraseptal grooves are absent in bats that have simpler (bar-shaped or curved) VNCs, this trait could be useful in fossil studies. Variable retention of some but not all functional elements of the vomeronasal complex suggests diverse mechanisms of VNO loss among some bat lineages. In this article, computed tomographic (CT) and traditional histological methods are used to study the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of bats. Iodine-enhanced micro-CT allows visualization of whole bat heads (above left, showing Anoura geoffroyi) as well as internal structures such as the nasal airway, or lumen of the VNO (shown in white and orange, respectively, at bottom left). Histology reveals details of the relationship of soft tissues and bone (top right: green arrow, showing a groove where vomeronasal cartilage articulates with the palate), and is still the preferred method for visualizing the epithelium of the VNO (bottom right, blue arrows indicate nuclei of sensory neurons). image","[Smith, Timothy D.; Rosenberger, Veronica B.; Loeffler, Julia R.; King, Nicholas A.] Slippery Rock Univ, Sch Phys Therapy, Slippery Rock, PA 16057 USA; [Downing, Sarah E.] Duquesne Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Curtis, Abigail A.; Santana, Sharlene E.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA USA; [Eiting, Thomas P.] Burrell Coll Osteopath Med, Dept Physiol & Pathol, Las Cruces, NM USA; [Santana, Sharlene E.] Univ Washington, Burke Museum Nat Hist & Culture, Seattle, WA USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Slippery Rock University - Pennsylvania; Duquesne University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Smith, TD (corresponding author), Slippery Rock Univ, Sch Phys Therapy, Slippery Rock, PA 16057 USA.",timothy.smith@sru.edu,,"Eiting, Thomas/0000-0001-8544-0993; Smith, Timothy/0000-0002-6883-8964; Downing, Sarah/0009-0002-0821-7565","National Science Foundation [IOS-2202271, IOS-2202272, IOS-2202273]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: IOS-2202271, IOS-2202272, IOS-2202273",,76,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1932-8486,1932-8494,,ANAT REC,Anat.

The characters include some associated with flower-visiting (two), echolocation (12), roosting (six), reproduction (two) and three are of unknown adaptive function. In both the 1998 and 2006 classifications of bats into suborders (Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera versus Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, respectively), some convergences between suborders are the same (e.g., foliage roosting, tent building), but others associated with echolocation differ substantially. In the 1998 phylogeny convergences associated with echolocation (high duty cycle echolocation, nasal emission of echolocation calls) occurred among the Microchiroptera. In the 2006 phylogeny, they occur between Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera. While some traits apparently arose independently in two suborders (e.g., foliage-roosting, tent building, low intensity echolocation calls, noseleafs, nasal emission of echolocation calls, high duty cycle echolocation behaviour), others appear to have been ancestral (roosting in narrow spaces, laryngeal echolocation, stylohyal-tympanic contact, oral emission of echolocation calls, and small litter size). A narrow profile through the chest is typical of bats reflecting the thoracic skeleton. This feature suggests that the ancestors of bats spent the day in small crevices. Features associated with laryngeal echolocation appear to be ancestral, suggesting that echolocation evolved early in bats but was subsequently lost in one yinpterochiropteran lineage [Current Zoology 56 (4): 454-468, 2010].","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Fenton, MB (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",bfenton@uwo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; K.F.

Consequently, there is limited knowledge to inform forest managers seeking to maintain or enhance bat habitat, particularly for several federally threatened, endangered, or candidate species. In summer 2017-2018, we conducted repeated acoustic surveys to determine what forest characteristics are associated with bat habitat use in managed forests in the Adirondack region of upstate New York. We modeled detection corrected probability of occupancy for bats in three phonic groups: high, mid, and low frequency. Across all phonic groups, probability of occupancy increased with decreasing canopy cover. High-, mid-, and low-frequency bats were more likely to use recently harvested sites (<10 years since harvest). High-frequency bats also used mature stands. Midfrequency bats demonstrated a preference for further distances from forest roads, whereas low-frequency bats preferred areas with a higher percentage of clutter. Our results suggest that tending and regenerating even-aged forest management practices can provide habitat for foraging bats in the Adirondacks. Study Implications: Several northeastern bat species have been granted or are candidates for federal endangered or threatened status; therefore, forest managers may increasingly need to consider how forest management actions affect bats. This research elucidates the effects of forest management practices on summer bat habitat use in northeastern forests. Foresters can use this information to limit negative impacts to bat habitat from management actions and identify management opportunities that protect or enhance bat habitat. All bat species we studied showed higher probability of use in stands with lower percent canopy cover, including stands recently harvested with the shelterwood method. However, special attention is owed to postharvest management to maintain suitable conditions, particularly concerning American beech. It is common in northeastern forests for beech to sprout root suckers following harvesting activities that can result in dense thickets, impeding bat flight abilities and limiting habitat connectivity for bats and other wildlife. Our findings also show that several bat species forage in mature stands that have a natural open understory and in areas around or near waterbodies. Consequently, evenaged tending and regeneration techniques in hardwood and mixed-wood forests, coupled with maintenance of nearby aquatic habitats, can provide habitat for bats.","[Gallagher, Megan E.; Farrell, Shannon L.; Germain, Rene H.; Rojas, Vanessa G.] SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry,"Gallagher, ME (corresponding author), SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",Megan.gallagher89@gmail.com; sfarrell@esf.edu; rhgermai@esf.edu; vgrojas@esf.edu,"Farrell, Shannon/L-3215-2016","Rojas, Vanessa Grace/0000-0003-0173-2708",USDA Forest Service; Edna Bailey Sussman Foundation; SUNY Research Foundation; Northeastern States Research Cooperative (NSRC),USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Edna Bailey Sussman Foundation; SUNY Research Foundation; Northeastern States Research Cooperative (NSRC),"This study was funded by the USDA Forest Service, Northeastern States Research Cooperative (NSRC), the Edna Bailey Sussman Foundation, and SUNY Research Foundation.

The most frequently measured habitat characteristics were roost-tree diameter (n = 23), roost-tree height (21), roost-tree canopy cover (16), roost height (14), and slope (10). Habitat characteristics of the roost tree itself were measured more frequently than stand or landscape characteristics; a total of 31 different habitat characteristics was used to describe stand or landscape conditions as opposed to 23 different habitat characteristics used to describe features of the roost tree. The overall mean ( SE) number of habitat characteristics examined per study was 8.0 +/- 1.1, with an average of 4.2 +/- 0.7 characteristics reported to be significant (P < 0.05). Mean estimated effect size, or the absolute value of the difference between means divided by the population standard deviation, of habitat characteristics ranged from 0.83 to 1.52. A sample size of 11 radio-tagged bats was sufficient to achieve acceptable power, i.e., 0.80, for all habitat characteristics examined when only using the upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals for estimated effect sizes. In contrast, a sample size of 39 radio-tagged bats was sufficient in achieving the same level of power for only 50% of the habitat characteristics evaluated at the lower end of the 95% confidence intervals. We encourage researchers to conduct pilot studies, and estimate effect sizes and variances to assess the level of sampling effort required to evaluate habitat characteristics in studies of tree-roosting bats.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Forestry, Lexington, KY 40546 USA",University of Kentucky,"Univ Kentucky, Dept Forestry, Lexington, KY 40546 USA.",mlacki@uky.edu,,,,,,,53,39,45,0,12,MUSEUM & INST ZOOLOGY PAS-POLISH ACAD SCIENCES,WARSAW,"WILCZA STREET 64, 00-679 WARSAW, POLAND",1508-1109,1733-5329,,ACTA CHIROPTEROL,Acta Chiropt.,,2003,5,2,,,,,199,208,,10.3161/001.005.0211,http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/001.005.0211,,,10,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,763LN,,Bronze,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000188087200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among them are filoviruses (e.g., Marburg, Ebola), coronaviruses (e.g., SARS, MERS), henipaviruses (e.g., Hendra, Nipah) which share the common features that they are all RNA viruses, and that a dysregulated immune response is an important contributor to the tissue damage and hence pathogenicity that results from infection in humans. Intriguingly, these viruses also all originate from bat reservoirs. Bats have been shown to have a greater mean viral richness than predicted by their phylogenetic distance from humans, their geographic range, or their presence in urban areas, suggesting other traits must explain why bats harbor a greater number of zoonotic viruses than other mammals. Bats are highly unusual among mammals in other ways as well. Not only are they the only mammals capable of powered flight, they have extraordinarily long life spans, with little detectable increases in mortality or senescence until high ages. Their physiology likely impacted their history of pathogen exposure and necessitated adaptations that may have also affected immune signaling pathways. Do our life history traits make us susceptible to generating damaging immune responses to RNA viruses or does the physiology of bats make them particularly tolerant or resistant? Understanding what immune mechanisms enable bats to coexist with RNA viruses may provide critical fundamental insights into how to achieve greater resilience in humans.","[Mandl, Judith N.] McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mandl, Judith N.; Schneider, Caitlin] McGill Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mandl, Judith N.; Schneider, Caitlin] McGill Univ, McGill Res Ctr Complex Traits, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Schneider, David S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Baker, Michelle L.] CSIRO, Australian Anim Hlth Lab, Hlth & Biosecur Business Unit, Geelong, Vic, Australia",McGill University; McGill University; McGill University; Stanford University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Mandl, JN (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Mandl, JN (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Mandl, JN (corresponding author), McGill Univ, McGill Res Ctr Complex Traits, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",judith.mandl@mcgill.ca,"Baker, Michelle/AAX-9171-2020; Baker, Michelle/C-9694-2013","Baker, Michelle/0000-0002-7993-9971; Schneider, Caitlin/0000-0001-8931-4847",,,,,138,73,76,4,88,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-3224,,,FRONT IMMUNOL,Front.

More than seventy Eocene bat species have been named to date, including stem bats, probable members of crown families, and others of uncertain affinity. Most phylogenetic analyses of Eocene bat relationships have focused on the handful of taxa known from nearly complete skeletal material, whereas the taxonomic relationships of more incomplete fossils have been based largely on phenetic similarities. Here we evaluate the evolutionary relationships of over 60 species of Eocene bats-including many taxa known only from fragmentary craniodental remains-in an explicitly phylogenetic context. Our analysis is based on nearly 700 morphological characters scored in 82 taxa, including 20 extant species representing all living bat families other than Pteropodidae. We found that phylogenetic relationships of Eocene bats are more complex than previously thought. Numerous families (e.g., dagger Archaeonycteridae, dagger Mixopterygidae, dagger Palaeochiropterygidae) and genera (e.g., dagger Archaeonycteris, dagger Icaronycteris, dagger Carcinipteryx) were found to be non-monophyletic as previously recognized, requiring adjustments to chiropteran taxonomy. Four major clades of stem bats were recovered in our analyses. dagger Microchiropteryx folieae (similar to 54 Ma, India) was recovered as the earliest crown bat, occurring as the most basal lineage of Vespertilionoidea, whereas many putative crown bats were recovered among stem Chiroptera. dagger Tachypteron franzeni was found to be a crown bat in our analyses, as in previous studies, but it was recovered unexpectedly as a stem miniopterid. The phylogenetic relationships presented here represent the most comprehensive analysis of Eocene bat relationships completed to date, substantially improving our understanding of the position of many fossil taxa within Chiroptera and providing a foundation for future analyses of bat evolution.","[Jones, Matthew F.; Beard, K.

These patterns of distributions can be explained by vegetation, and climatic factors, and are determined by historical and current factors. The continuous accumulation of information on the distribution patterns of species is essential to understand the history and evolution of the biota. In this study, we aimed to identify functional and evolutionary drivers that explain the geographic patterns of vertical stratification. We compiled morphological, ecological, and distribution data of 140 species of Chacoan snakes and constructed null models to map their geographic pattern. We used a range of environmental variables to assess which drivers are influencing these biogeographic patterns. Lastly, we used evolutionary data to build the first map of the phylogenetic regions of Chacoan snakes. We found a latitudinal pattern, with a marked verticality in the snake assemblies in the Chaco. Verticality and long-tailed species richness increased in areas with high stratified habitats and stable temperature. Fossoriality is driven mainly by soil conditions, especially soils with fewer sand particles and less stratified habitat. Phylogenetic regions in the Chaco showed a marked latitudinal pattern, like that observed in the geographic pattern of verticality. The distribution pattern of Chacoan snakes also reflects their evolutionary history, with a marked phylogenetic regionalization.","[Cabral, Hugo] Univ Estadual Paulista, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, BR-15054000 Sao Jose Do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil; [Cabral, Hugo] Inst Invest Biol Paraguay, Asuncion, Paraguay; [Cabral, Hugo; Santana, Diego J.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Mapinguari Lab Biogeog & Sistemat Anfibios & Rept, Inst Biociencias, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Guedes, Thais B.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Campinas, Brazil; [Guedes, Thais B.] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg Global Biodivers Ctr, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Guedes, Thais B.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Biological Research Institute of Paraguay (IIBP); Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade de Sao Paulo; University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg,"Cabral, H (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, BR-15054000 Sao Jose Do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil.",huguitocabral@gmail.com,"Guedes, Thais/U-9342-2017; Cabral, Hugo/N-7015-2018; Jose Santana, Diego/G-5257-2012","Guedes, Thais/0000-0003-3318-7193; Cabral, Hugo/0000-0002-0320-9411; Jose Santana, Diego/0000-0002-8789-3061","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Paraguay; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [309420/2020-2]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Paraguay; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES))","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Paraguay, Grant/Award Number: PRONII; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 309420/2020--2; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Grant/Award Number: PEC--PG; Universidade Estadual do Maranhao",,83,2,2,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The disturbance by cyclones adds to the anthropic disturbance and generates important effects on ecosystems. Bats are ideal bioindicators that show several responses to impacts of hurricanes in insular systems. However, little is known about their usefulness in assessing impacts of hurricanes in continental regions. We aimed to analyze the short-term impact of Hurricane Patricia (category 4) and anthropic disturbance on the diversity of bats in coastal Jalisco, Mexico, and on abundance of functional groups. We sampled bats at three locations before Hurricane Patricia and eight months after. During a sampling effort of 7091 m(2) of netting we captured 487 bats of 17 species, 12 of which were phyllostomids. We detected a decrease in diversity of bats and a more similar composition of species among locations after the hurricane, and a greater stability in species composition and trophic structure in the location with more conserved dry forest. Bats responded in different ways according to functional group. The most vulnerable species were nectarivores, small, with low mobility, and with preferences for understory and cavities. However, their changes in abundance were different among locations and habitats. Conversely, abundance of frugivores-omnivores and insectivores was greater after the hurricane. Additionally, greater changes in abundance among functional groups were in more disturbed sites. Our results indicate that maintaining primary forest and remnants of secondary dry forests is vital to mitigate the effects of major natural disturbances on biodiversity in continental regions.","[Maria Sil-Berra, Luz] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico; [Sanchez-Hernandez, Cornelio; Hugo Reynoso, Victor] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico; [de Lourdes Romero-Almaraz, Maria] Escuinapa 92 Bis Col Pedregal De Santo Domingo, Ciudad De Mexico 04369, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Sánchez-Hernández, C (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico.",,"Reynoso, Victor/AHA-8204-2022","Sil-Berra, Luz Maria/0000-0001-5369-4315","Instituto de Biologia, UNAM; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) scholarship [400 449]; Southwestern Association of Naturalists (SWAN) through the Howard McCarley Award in 2016","Instituto de Biologia, UNAM(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) scholarship(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Southwestern Association of Naturalists (SWAN) through the Howard McCarley Award in 2016","Fieldwork was largely supported by F.

However, studies on wing morphology, as well as the ecology of Japanese bats, are largely lacking. In this study, we aimed to enrich the wing morphology data of Japanese bats. The wing variables, including forearm length, aspect ratio, relative wing loading, and wing tip shape index, were assessed using museum and private specimens of 34 Japanese bat species. Hierarchical clustering of the wing variables classified the bats into nine clusters to predict their foraging ecology, including the species for which ecological knowledge was lacking. Based on the ecological knowledge of Japanese bats, the aspect ratio of bats belonging to the open-space foraging guild was significantly higher than that of those belonging to other guilds. In contrast, the wing tip shape index of bats belonging to the narrow-space foraging guild was significantly higher than those belonging to the other guilds. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the complex interplay between wing morphology and foraging ecology in Japanese bats, offering insights for future research and conservation efforts.","[Maki, Takahiro] Kagoshima Univ, Int Ctr Isl Studies, Amami Stn, Kagoshima 8940026, Japan; [Maki, Takahiro] Univ Tokyo, Univ Tokyo Forest, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo, Tokyo 0791561, Japan; [Fukui, Dai] Univ Tokyo, Fuji Iyashinomori Woodland Study Ctr, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 341-2 Yamanaka, Yamanakako, Yamanashi 4010501, Japan",Kagoshima University; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Fukui, D (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Fuji Iyashinomori Woodland Study Ctr, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 341-2 Yamanaka, Yamanakako, Yamanashi 4010501, Japan.",yamakoumori23@gmail.com; fukuidai@uf.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Fukui, Dai/D-6100-2013","Fukui, Dai/0000-0002-5449-4283","JSPS KAKENHI [JP 21H04923]; JST SPRING [JPMJSP2108]; Innovative model fusing conservation of biological and cultural diversity with regional revitalization in the Amami archipelago, Mission Progressive Strategy at Kagoshima University","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JST SPRING; Innovative model fusing conservation of biological and cultural diversity with regional revitalization in the Amami archipelago, Mission Progressive Strategy at Kagoshima University","We are sincerely grateful to Shin-Ichiro Kawada, Mitsuru Mukohyama, and Kishio Maeda for allowing us to access the specimens in their collections.

Thinning of these forests is a widespread management practice that can affect forest species, including echolocating bats and their prey. We compared total activity of 11 bat taxa, foraging activity of six bat guilds and biomass of 11 insect orders across four forest thinning categories in managed remnant eucalypt forests in south-eastern Australia: unthinned regrowth, forest thinned recently (0-4years) and in the medium term (5-10years) and reference (mature open forest). Thinning had been carried out at large (350ha) spatial scales. Total bat activity was 60% less and foraging activity was 80% less in unthinned regrowth, compared to reference sites, but activity levels were similar among thinned and reference sites. Insect biomass was greatest in unthinned sites, and while bat activity was related to prey biomass, this relationship was weak in unthinned sites. Together, this suggests that forest structure was more important than prey availability or time since thinning in influencing bat activity patterns. Synthesizing our findings with the broader literature on bats and thinning, we found support for a clutter threshold of 1100 stems ha(-1), above which bat activity was markedly lower, across two continents (the USA and Australia) and four broad vegetation types (eucalypt, conifer, deciduous and mixed forests). While elsewhere bats with adaptive traits for open habitats generally respond positively to thinning, in our study, species with traits consistent with clutter tolerance (high call frequency and low wing aspect ratio) had lowest activity levels (up to 22 times) in unthinned regrowth compared to all other forest types.Synthesis and applications. Widespread dense regrowth forest can restrict movement and foraging of bats, even those adapted to clutter. We recommend thinning dense regrowth or plantations to below 1100 stems ha(-1) when targeting bat foraging habitat, but effects of thinning on roost habitat and other forest biota require further investigation.

We also quantified forest cover in buffers of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 m around each patch, and tree height, basal area, canopy cover, and vegetation clutter in the understorey at the patch level. We used hierarchical partitioning to relate the different indices with our predictor variables.Results Taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in the wet season increased with the proportion of forest cover in the 2500 m buffer. Vegetation clutter was negatively related to taxonomic and functional diversity in the wet season. In the dry season, average tree height positively affected taxonomic and functional diversity. Patch-level variables were more important than forest cover in explaining the average functional traits in both seasons.Conclusion We found seasonal variation in the relationships between components of bat diversity and different drivers. Since both forest cover in the landscape and patch-level variables are important for Phyllostomid bat diversity, conservation plans should consider forest conservation at the landscape level and maintenance of forest patch quality.","[Carvalho, William Douglas] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Terr Ecol Grp TEG UAM, Madrid, Spain; [Carvalho, William Douglas] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Invest Biodivers & Cambio Global CIBC UAM, Madrid, Spain; [Carvalho, William Douglas; Hilario, Renato; Marques, Tiago Miranda; de Toledo, Jose Julio; Mustin, Karen] Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade Trop, Macapa, Brazil; [Carvalho, William Douglas] Univ Fed Grande Dourados UFGD, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade & Meio Ambiente, Dourados, Brazil; [Carvalho, William Douglas; Hilario, Renato; Marques, Tiago Miranda; de Toledo, Jose Julio] Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Dept Meio Ambiente & Desenvolvimento, Lab Ecol, Macapa, Brazil; [Rosalino, Luis Miguel; Palmeirim, Jorge M.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Lisbon, Portugal; [Rosalino, Luis Miguel; Palmeirim, Jorge M.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Lisbon, Portugal; [Xavier, Bruna da Silva; Vieira, Marcus Vinicius] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Castro, Isai Jorge] Inst Pesquisas Cient & Tecnol Estado Amapa IEPA, Lab Mamiferos, Macapa, Brazil",Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid; Fundacao Universidade Federal do Amapa; Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados; Fundacao Universidade Federal do Amapa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Carvalho, WD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Dept Meio Ambiente & Desenvolvimento, Lab Ecol, Macapa, Brazil.",wilruoca@hotmail.com,"de Toledo, José/V-2465-2019; Mustin, Karen/J-3186-2019; Vieira, Marcus/U-5314-2019; Xavier, Bruna/K-2260-2016; Hilário, Renato/A-7158-2013; Vieira, Marcus Vinicius/D-2540-2011; Castro, Isai/I-5094-2013; Palmeirim, Jorge/A-1323-2014; Rosalino, Luis Miguel/B-9406-2009; Carvalho, William Douglas/H-7894-2015","Vieira, Marcus Vinicius/0000-0002-4472-5447; Castro, Isai/0000-0003-2924-7886; Palmeirim, Jorge/0000-0003-4734-8162; Xavier, Bruna/0000-0001-9390-5041; Rosalino, Luis Miguel/0000-0003-4186-7332; Carvalho, William Douglas/0000-0003-2518-9148","Neotropical Grassland Conservancy [01098803-5]; National Geographic Society [EC-59186R-19, NGS-83254R-20]; Bat Conservation International [2434131]; Rufford Foundation [25585-1]; CRUE-CSIC; Springer Nature",Neotropical Grassland Conservancy; National Geographic Society(National Geographic Society); Bat Conservation International; Rufford Foundation; CRUE-CSIC; Springer Nature,"Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.

The variety of automatic recorders, the development of free analytical tools, and several acoustic indices have increased the number of studies worldwide. The bioacoustic approach is essential for application in poorly surveyed regions with the pressure of human activities, such as the Brazilian cerrado. We tested the association of four bat diversity metrics (taxonomic, phylogenetic, and two functional diversity metrics, being one based on morphological and the other on acoustical traits, with five commonly used acoustic indices. We used a dataset of 608.4 h obtained from 30 sampling points in three protected areas in Central Brazil. Using Flexible Discriminant Analysis, we identified 21 bat species used in our subsequent analysis. The Entropy index was the best predictor of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, whereas the Acoustic Complexity Index was the best predictor of functional morphological diversity. We concluded that acoustic indices are suitable for estimating the diversity of insectivorous bats in the cerrado. However, we registered only part of the bat community, and bats can vary seasonally masking the real diversity of the study area; thus, this method should be used parsimoniously.","[de Aguiar Silva, Claysson; Silveira, Mauricio; Aguiar, Ludmilla M.

Consequently, their musculoskeletal system is significantly reorganized, and the four-legged locomotion is fundamentally different from that of typical mammals. To date, the largest amount of data on bat terrestrial locomotion concerns those species for which this type of movement has become an essential component of foraging behavior. Quadrupedal locomotion of other bats remains virtually unstudied. In this paper, we present the result of an experimental analysis of four-legged terrestrial locomotion of five species of vespertilionid bats. The study is based on a combination of two methods: 1) high-speed video recording from two angles, and 2) tracks and traces analysis. Temporal, metric and speed parameters of locomotion in different species are estimated, and the dependence of these characteristics on each other is shown. Such parameters have been studied for bats for the first time.

I tested for correlations between species-specific diet selection and relative brain and hippocampus volumes in the New World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae). To this end, I classified each of 53 species from this ecologically diverse family as one of the following: (i) predatory, (ii) omnivorous, (iii) frugivorous, or (iv) nectivorous. Species-level analyses and the comparative method (i.e. phylogenetically independent contrasts) revealed that relative hippocampus volume was greater in predatory species than in frugivorous and nectivorous species and that relative brain size was greater in frugivorous species than in predatory species. As previously reported, specialized frugivory appears to be associated with increased relative brain volume suggesting these two traits evolve together. I suggest some plausible functional explanations for variation in hippocampus volume in light of our current understanding of the acquisition of spatial information and its use by echolocating bats.

We show that phytoplankton species richness in an unbalanced nutrient supply context was influenced by wind-driven processes, ecological specialization for dissolved inorganic phosphorous, temporal niche differentiation, and a competition-defense and/or a growth-defense trade-off, a coexistence mechanism where weak competitors (i.e., slower growing) are better protected against predation. Under the influence of both environmental perturbations (e.g., wind-driven processes, freshwater influence, unbalanced nutrient levels) and biotic interactions (e.g., competition, predation, facilitation), phytoplankton species exhibited specific survival strategies such as investment on growth, adaptation and tolerance of species to environmental stresses, silicification and resource specialization. These strategies have led to more speciose communities, higher productivity, functional redundancy and stability in the last decade. Our results revealed that the unbalanced nutrient reduction facilitated Phaeocystis blooms and that anthropogenic climate warming and nitrate reduction may threaten the diatom communities of the eastern English Channel in a near future. Our results provide strong support for biogeographical historical and niche-based processes in structuring the phytoplankton community in this temperate region. The variety of species responses that we characterized in this region may help to better understand future changes in pelagic ecosystems, and can serve as a basis to consider functional approaches for future ecosystem management.","[Breton, Elsa; Skouroliakou, Dimitra-Ioli; Seuront, Laurent; Beaugrand, Gregory; Kleparski, Loick; Crouvoisier, Muriel; Cauvin, Arnaud; Poquet, Adrien; Christaki, Urania] Univ Littoral Cole dOpale, CNRS, Univ Lille, UMR 8187,LOG, Wimereux, France; [Goberville, Eric] Univ Antilles, Sorbonne Univ, Unite Biol Organismes & Ecosyst Aquat BOREA, Museum Natl Hist Nat,CNRS,IRD, Paris, France; [Sautour, Benoit; Ouadi, Anis] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR EPOC 5805, Rue Geoffroy St Hilaire Batiment B18N, Pessac, France; [Seuront, Laurent] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Resources & Energy, Tokyo, Japan; [Seuront, Laurent] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, Grahamstown, South Africa; [Kleparski, Loick] Marine Biol Assoc UK, Continuous Plankton Recorder CPR Survey, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Pecqueur, David; Salmeron, Christophe] Observ Oceanol Banyuls S Mer, Lab Arago SU CNRS, FR 3724, Ave Pierre Fabre Bat B, Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Poquet, Adrien] Univ Cote dAzur, CNRS, INSERM, IRCAN,Med Sch Nice, Nice, France; [Garcia, Nicole] Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Toulon, CNRS, IRD,MIO, Marseille, France; [Gohin, Francis] IFREMER, Lab Ecol Pelag, DYNECO PELAGOS, CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Lille; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Bordeaux; Tokyo University of Marine Science & Technology; Rhodes University; Marine Biological Association United Kingdom; Sorbonne Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Ifremer,"Breton, E (corresponding author), Univ Littoral Cole dOpale, CNRS, Univ Lille, UMR 8187,LOG, Wimereux, France.",elsa.breton@univ-littoral.fr,"BEAUGRAND, GREGORY/LWI-2327-2024; Kléparski, Loïck/IXX-0047-2023; elsa, Breton/J-4996-2013; Goberville, Eric/A-2621-2017","Muriel, CROUVOISIER/0000-0003-2281-5326; Pecqueur, David/0000-0002-4666-6030; Kleparski, Loick/0000-0002-7536-2941; Goberville, Eric/0000-0002-1843-7855; SKOUROLIAKOU, DIMITRA-IOLI/0000-0003-0325-4754; Breton, Elsa/0000-0002-9569-5436",,,,,217,9,9,9,49,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Cranial ecomorphological adaptations linked to diet have been widely studied in bats, using a variety of anatomical, computational and mathematical approaches. However, foraging-related ecomorphological adaptations and the concordance between cranial and postcranial morphological adaptations remain unexamined in bats and limited to the interpretation of traditional aerodynamic properties of the wing (e.g. wing loading [WL] and aspect ratio [AR]). For this reason, the postcranial ecomorphological diversity in bats and its drivers remain understudied. Using 3D virtual modelling and geometric morphometrics (GMM), we explored the phylogenetic, ecological and biological drivers of humeral morphology in bats, evaluating the presence and magnitude of modularity and integration. To explore decoupled patterns of variation across the bone, we analysed whole-bone shape, diaphyseal and epiphyseal shape. We also tested whether traditional aerodynamic wing traits correlate with humeral shape. By studying 37 species from 20 families (covering all FGs and 85% of dietary guilds), we found similar patterns of variation in whole-bone and diaphyseal shape and unique variation patterns in epiphyseal shape. Phylogeny, diet and FG significantly correlated with shape variation at all levels, whereas size only had a significant effect on epiphyseal morphology. We found a significant phylogenetic signal in all levels of humeral shape. Epiphyseal shape significantly correlated with wing AR. Statistical support for a diaphyseal-epiphyseal modular partition of the humerus suggests a functional partition of shape variability. Our study is the first to show within-structure modular morphological variation in the appendicular skeleton of any living tetrapod. Our results suggest that diaphyseal shape correlates more with phylogeny, whereas epiphyseal shape correlates with diet and FG.","[Lopez-Aguirre, Camilo; Hand, Suzanne J.; Wilson, Laura A.

Bat boxes have been used for over a century to provide artificial cavities. The aims of this review were to provide a synthesis of bat box use in temperate parts of the world, to discuss the applications and effectiveness of bat boxes, to provide box deployment recommendations and to identify areas requiring further research. The 109 publications reviewed originated from four regions. The majority were from Europe (70%) followed by North America (16%), Australia (12%) and Asia (3%). Publications reported box use for research (n = 67), conservation management (n = 42) and public bat awareness (n = 1). The most commonly used bat box designs could be divided into five basic types, four originating from Europe and one from North America. Woodcement as a box material was frequently used in Europe and was practically absent elsewhere with timber boxes most commonly used overall. Seventy-one species of bats have been recorded using boxes, although only 18 were identified as using boxes commonly and 31 species were reported to have formed maternity roosts. The lack of maternity and overwintering roost records in boxes is a concern. There is a need to test current box types across geographical regions and to develop designs further. Where boxes are used as a conservation tool, consideration should be given to the long-term maintenance costs of a box program. Unless known to be unsuitable to target species, boxes should be made from durable materials, be unattractive to non-target species and be 'self-cleaning'. Deploying a variety of box designs in clusters, time since box installation, non-target species box competition and target species-specific box design elements are likely influencing box uptake. The provision of boxes that comprise different microclimates and box aspects are likely best suited to meet the varying needs of a given tree roosting echolocating bat community. No conclusive evidence was found that box installation height is important for box uptake. There is concern that boxes may provide a competitive advantage for bat species commonly using boxes. Bat boxes should not be used as a justification for the removal of trees that comprise potential roost cavities.","[Rueegger, Niels] So Cross Univ, Australia Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Rueegger, Niels] 43 Rutland Rd, Bath, NSW 2780, Australia",Southern Cross University,"Rueegger, N (corresponding author), So Cross Univ, Australia Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia.;Rueegger, N (corresponding author), 43 Rutland Rd, Bath, NSW 2780, Australia.",niels_ruegger@hotmail.com,,,Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; MA Ingram Trust; Australian Geographic Society; Australian Postgraduate Award (APA),Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; MA Ingram Trust; Australian Geographic Society; Australian Postgraduate Award (APA)(Australian Government),"This paper greatly benefited from the review by Ruth and Sacha Perram and four anonymous reviewers.

Morphological trait variation within species influences the energetic cost of locomotion and impacts life history traits, with ecological and evolutionary consequences. This study examined wing morphology correlates of flight performance measured by energetic expenditure in the Seba's short-tailed bat, Carollia perspicillata. In the flight experiments, nature caught bats (59 females, 57 males) were allowed to fly for 3 min in a room. After each flight, thermographic images were taken to measure body temperature, and biophysical models were used to calculate sensible heat loss as a measure of energetic expenditure. Wing morphological traits were measured for each individual and associated with heat loss and power required to fly on performance surfaces. Wing morphological traits explained 7-10% of flight energetic cost, and morphologies with the best performance would save the energy equivalent to 9-30% of total daily requirements. The optimal performance areas within the C. perspicillata morphospace were consistent with predicted selection trends from the literature. A trade-off between demands for flight speed and maneuverability was observed. Wing loading and camber presented sexual dimorphism. These morphological differences are likely associated with more economical but less maneuverable flight in females, leading them to fly more often in open areas along the forest edge. Our findings demonstrate how small scale changes in wing morphology can affect life history strategies and fitness.","[Carneiro, Lucas de Oliveira; Mellado, Breno; Nogueira, Marcelo Rodrigues; Monteiro, Leandro Rabello] Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Ctr Biociencias & Biotecnol, Lab Ciencias Ambientais, Campos Goytacazes, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Biodiversidade, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Carneiro, Lucas de Oliveira; Monteiro, Leandro Rabello] Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Ctr Biociencias & Biotecnol, Lab Ciencias Ambientais, Ave Alberto Lamego,2000 Campos Goytacazes, BR-28013602 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense,"Carneiro, LD; Monteiro, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Ctr Biociencias & Biotecnol, Lab Ciencias Ambientais, Ave Alberto Lamego,2000 Campos Goytacazes, BR-28013602 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",luc.oliveira.carneiro@gmail.com; breno_mellado_rocha@hotmail.com; nogueiramr@gmail.com; ap.cruz-neto@unesp.br; lrmont@uenf.br,"Monteiro, Leandro/B-7882-2009; Cruz-Neto, Ariovaldo/B-2958-2013","Carneiro, Lucas/0000-0003-4834-7989; Cruz-Neto, Ariovaldo/0000-0001-5270-7276; Monteiro, Leandro/0000-0002-0725-3647",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/16/320-7]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors would like to thank ICMBIO staff at Rebio Uniao for providing support and infrastructure.

Our review frames the swarming period as a time of critical transitions, during which bats must balance multiple life history trade-offs, and we consider how various intrinsic and extrinsic factors may contribute to inter-and intraspecific differences in autumn behaviour. We discuss the transition away from summer residency, including maternity colony breakup, day roosting, and migration during autumn. We review key life history elements of swarming, including mating behaviours and associated reproductive condition, genetic exchange during swarming, and variation among sexes, ages, and species. Finally, we discuss the behaviours and physiological states of bats transitioning from the swarming period to hibernation. Throughout, we identify common patterns and also exceptions. Over 50 years of research has yielded many insights into autumn swarming, but knowledge gaps remain. Future research focus on a greater diversity of species will reveal general principles underlying the transition from summer active season, through the swarming period, and into winter hibernation.","[Fraser, Erin E.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Sch Sci & Environm, Univ Dr,Grenfell Campus, Corner Brook, PQ A2H 5G4, Canada; [McGuire, Liam P.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Univ Ave, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland; University of Waterloo,"Fraser, EE (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Sch Sci & Environm, Univ Dr,Grenfell Campus, Corner Brook, PQ A2H 5G4, Canada.",efraser@grenfell.mun.ca,"McGuire, Liam/CAE-8434-2022","McGuire, Liam/0000-0002-5690-0804",,,,,133,6,6,6,19,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"123 Slater Street, Suite 610, OTTAWA, ON K1P 5H2, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Two gleaning bats, the Japanese long-eared bat ( Plecotus sacrimontis) ) and the Ussuri tube- nosed bat ( Murina ussuriensis), ), have similar eco-morphological traits, but it is unclear how they coexist. We examined the seasonal fecal contents of these species in the cool temperate forest of Mount Fuji, central Japan, using microscopical analysis. Long-eared bats, which have larger pinnae, more frequently consumed tympanate insects, such as adult moths, during early spring to summer, whereas tube-nosed bats, which have smaller pinnae, more frequently consumed non-tympanate insects such as caterpillars and grasshoppers, during spring to early summer and summer to autumn, respectively. Interestingly, they consumed insects of the same order but different developmental stages (i.e., adult moths and caterpillars) during spring to early summer, which revelation was made possible by microscopic analysis, not by DNA analysis. These differences suggest that the large pinna of the long-eared bat is an adaptation for preying on tympanate insects, which resulted in food resource partitioning. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, the Ussuri tube-nosed bat can be considered one of the bats that most frequently eats caterpillars.","[Takada, Hayato] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Wildlife Management Ctr, 3-5-8 Saiwai Cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan; [Takada, Hayato; Nakamura, Keita; Ohwaki, Atsushi] Mt Fuji Res Inst Yamanashi Prefecture Govt, 5597-1 Kenmarubi, Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi 4030005, Japan; [Sato, Akiyoshi; Katsuta, Setsuko] Almas Co Ltd, 3-5-26 Honcho,Iwatsuki, Saitama, Saitama 3390057, Japan; [Ohwaki, Atsushi] JF Oberlin Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, 3758 Tokiwa Machi, Machida, Tokyo 1940294, Japan; [Kane, Yuto; Inoue, Eiji] Toho Univ, Fac Sci, Miyama 2-2-1, Funabashi, Chiba 2748510, Japan; [Hayakawa, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, N10W5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan",Tokyo University of Agriculture & Technology; Toho University; Hokkaido University,"Takada, H (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Wildlife Management Ctr, 3-5-8 Saiwai Cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan.;Takada, H (corresponding author), Mt Fuji Res Inst Yamanashi Prefecture Govt, 5597-1 Kenmarubi, Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi 4030005, Japan.",capricornis.murina.8810@gmail.com,"Takada, Hayato/ABE-1358-2020; Ohwaki, Atsushi/I-4788-2019; Hayakawa, Takashi/U-9518-2018","Inoue, Eiji/0000-0002-3292-115X; Takada, Hayato/0000-0003-2118-8762; Hayakawa, Takashi/0000-0002-1037-0350",,,"Ken Amano (Fujiyoshida City) gave us permission to conduct an investigation at the building.

High levels of offtake were reported throughout Asia, the Pacific islands and some Western Indian Ocean islands, where fruit bats of the genus Pteropus are eaten extensively. Most hunting in Africa was reported in western states and the largest fruit bat Eidolon helvum was preferred. Insectivorous bats are also eaten, particularly Tadarida in Asia. Hunting is both for local consumption and commercial, sometimes involving cross-border transactions. The high levels of hunting reported and the low reproductive rate of bats indicate there are likely to be severe negative effects on bat populations, and declines of several species are documented. Although there has been only one reported attempt to manage offtake, this indicates that it is possible and apparently successful. Furthermore, voluntary controls on hunting have halted declines in bat numbers. There have been several initiatives to reduce hunting pressure and conserve threatened bat species, mainly on islands that, when sustained, have been successful. More education projects and community-based conservation initiatives should be encouraged together with further attempts at sustainable harvesting in situations where disease risk has been evaluated.","[Racey, Paul] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Mickleburgh, Simon; Waylen, Kerry] Fauna & Flora Int, Cambridge, England",University of Aberdeen,"Racey, P (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.",p.racey@abdn.ac.uk,"Waylen, Kerry/B-1867-2008","Waylen, Kerry/0000-0002-6593-2795",,,,,113,144,167,2,90,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0030-6053,1365-3008,,ORYX,Oryx,APR,2009,43,2,,,,,217,234,,10.1017/S0030605308000938,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0030605308000938,,,18,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,450WR,,Bronze,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000266432600018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Bats possess extraordinary adaptations including powered flight, laryngeal echolocation and a unique immune system that enables them to tolerate a diversity of viral infections without presenting clinical disease symptoms. They occupy multiple trophic niches and environments globally. Significant physiological and ecological diversity occurs across the order. Bats also exhibit extreme longevity given their body size with many species showing few signs of ageing. The molecular basis of this extended longevity has recently attracted attention. Telomere maintenance potentially underpins bats' extended healthspan, although functional studies are still required to validate the causative mechanisms. In this review, we detail the current knowledge on bat telomeres, telomerase expression, and how these relate to ecology, longevity and life-history strategies. Patterns of telomere shortening and telomerase expression vary across species, and comparative genomic analyses suggest that alternative telomere maintenance mechanisms evolved in the longest-lived bats. We discuss the unique challenges faced when working with populations of wild bats and highlight ways to advance the field including expanding long-term monitoring across species that display contrasting life-histories and occupy different environmental niches. We further review how new high quality, chromosome-level genome assemblies can enable us to uncover the molecular mechanisms governing telomere dynamics and how phylogenomic analyses can reveal the adaptive significance of telomere maintenance and variation in bats.","[Power, Megan L.; Teeling, Emma C.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sci Ctr West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Belfield, Ireland; [Foley, Nicole M.] Texas A&M Univ, Vet Integrat Biosci, College Stn, TX USA; [Jones, Gareth] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",University College Dublin; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Bristol,"Teeling, EC (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sci Ctr West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland.",emma.teeling@ucd.ie,,"Jones, Gareth/0000-0002-1904-3735; Foley, Nicole/0000-0002-8169-9436; Power, Megan/0000-0001-7402-3254; Teeling, Emma/0000-0002-3309-1346",Irish Research Council [IRCLA/2017/58]; Science Foundation Ireland [19/FFP/6790]; IReL; WOA Institution: University College Dublin; Blended DEAL: IReL; Irish Research Council (IRC) [IRCLA/2017/58] Funding Source: Irish Research Council (IRC),"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)); IReL; WOA Institution: University College Dublin; Blended DEAL: IReL; Irish Research Council (IRC)(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)","Irish Research Council, Grant/Award Number: IRCLA/2017/58; Science Foundation Ireland, Grant/Award Number: 19/FFP/6790; Open access funding provided by IReL.

If such behavior is adaptive, these costs should be balanced by benefits associated with moving. The Chiroptera is an excellent group in which to investigate the costs and benefits of such movements because roost fidelity is variable among species of bats. Reviewing the fidelity of 43 species of bats, I found that 25 frequently change roosts, 14 rarely change, and 4 show intraspecific variability in fidelity. A comparative analysis that controlled for phylogeny demonstrated that fidelity is related to the type of roost occupied: high fidelity is directly related to roost permanency and inversely related to roost availability. Lability may result from trade-offs between the benefits of fidelity (e.g., greater site familiarity, maintenance of social relationships, and retention of roosts particularly suited for raising offspring) versus those of lability (e.g., decreased commuting costs to foraging areas, familiarity with several roosts that differ in microclimate, lower probability of predator detection, and lower ectoparasite levels).","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,,,,"Lewis, Susan/0000-0003-4557-4123",,,,,104,483,581,2,159,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

We used abundance, functional, and phylogenetic information to determine if Neotropical bat communities exhibited phylogenetic or functional overdispersion or underdispersion in response to habitat conversion. Overdispersion suggests the operation of intraclade competition, niche partitioning, limiting similarity, or character displacement, whereas underdispersion indicates the operation of interclade competition, abiotic filtering, or biotic filtering. We expected (1) biotic filtering in landscapes with extensive forest loss to result in underdispersion; (2) niche partitioning in heterogeneous landscapes with intermediate forest loss to result in overdispersion; and (3) intraclade competition during times of low resource abundance (i.e., dry season) to increase, resulting in overdispersion. Most bat communities exhibited phylogenetic or functional underdispersion; none exhibited overdispersion. Expectations were not met: underdispersion did not increase with forest loss, heterogeneous landscapes did not induce overdispersion, and no evidence supported the contention that intraclade competition changed with season. Empirical responses were season-specific, likely because resource availability may affect relationships between forest cover and underdispersion and between biodiversity and underdispersion. During the dry season, only high diversity sites exhibited underdispersion (i.e., functional or phylogenetic redundancy), whereas underdispersion occurred in low, intermediate, or high diversity communities during the wet season; we suggest that this difference likely arises due to changes in resource abundance. Communities with high diversity and redundancy occupied heterogeneous sites during the dry season, but communities with high redundancy were restricted to large forest reserves during the wet season.","[Presley, Steven J.; Cisneros, Laura M.; Klingbeil, Brian T.; Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, 3107 Horsebarn Hill Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Presley, Steven J.; Klingbeil, Brian T.; Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 75 North Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Cisneros, Laura M.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, 1376 Storrs Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Higgins, Christopher L.] Tarleton State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stephenville, TX 76402 USA; [Scheiner, Samuel M.] Natl Sci Fdn, Div Environm Biol, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; Texas A&M University System; Tarleton State University; National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO); NSF - Division of Environmental Biology (DEB),"Presley, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, 3107 Horsebarn Hill Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Presley, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 75 North Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",steven.presley@uconn.edu,"Scheiner, Samuel/A-4320-2009; Presley, Steven/AAE-9189-2020","Willig, Michael/0000-0001-6884-9957; Klingbeil, Brian/0000-0002-0669-5179; Higgins, Christopher/0000-0002-5244-0345; Presley, Steven James/0000-0002-5987-0735","National Science Foundation [DEB-1050680, DEB-1239764, DEB-1546686]; Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of Connecticut",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of Connecticut,"This work was facilitated by participation of SJP, LMC, BTK and MRW in a project entitled The Dimensions of Biodiversity Distributed Graduate Seminar, funded by a National Science Foundation grant to S.

Stemming from a putatively insectivorous ancestor, noctilionoid bats diversified to adapt to the widest range of dietary ecologies among mammals. The high concentration of noctilionoid diversity in the Neotropics raises the question as to whether competitive ecological interactions influenced their diversification. However, patterns of morphological diversification along gradients of coexistence in Noctilionoidea are understudied. Here, we assessed the effect of dietary adaptations on patterns of morphological divergence associated with coexistence in noctilionoid bats.Location: The Americas and the Caribbean.Taxon: Bat superfamily Noctilionoidea.Methods: Using a set of five dental morphological traits and a sample of 108 species, we quantified morphological distances between noctilionoid species pairs to reveal patterns of morphological divergence along gradients of range overlap and dietary similarity. We incorporate phylogenetic information to control for the effects of species' relatedness on morphological distances.Results: Overall, we found a significant association between morphological divergence, coexistence and diet. Decomposing the correlation between morphological divergence and sympatry across dietary groups, our results revealed distinctive pat-terns consistent with both character convergence and divergence. Specifically, we found evidence of character convergence in herbivorous species and character diver-gence in omnivorous species.Main Conclusions: Our results indicate that the morphological diversification of noc-tilionoid bats followed parallel evolutionary trajectories of directional (both divergent and stabilising) and nonselective evolution linked to dietary adaptations.","[Lopez-Aguirre, Camilo; Silcox, Mary T.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Anthropol, Scarborough, ON, Canada; [Lopez-Aguirre, Camilo; Ratcliffe, John M.] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"López-Aguirre, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Anthropol, Scarborough, ON, Canada.",c.lopezaguirre@utoronto.ca,"Silcox, Mary/JXN-5342-2024; Lopez-Aguirre, Camilo/H-6524-2019",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Toronto Scarborough,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); University of Toronto Scarborough(University of Toronto),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Toronto Scarborough,,66,1,1,4,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Bats developed ultrasonic echolocation to hunt, and in response some arthropods developed defense mechanisms such as ultrasonic hearing, allowing them to elude bat predators. The present study analyzes the feeding patterns of bats, focusing on sonic-auditory sensory mechanisms in predator-prey interactions. Next-generation DNA sequence data from fecal samples were used to analyze the diet of 17 bat species from Mexico. Arthropod prey taxa were classified according to their auditory traits, and echolocation data were recompiled from literature review. We: (i) classified arthropod families according to their hearing ability; (ii) estimated arthropod taxon richness and proportion in the diet of each bat species; and (iii) used multidimensional scaling, principal component analysis, and regression to analyze prey consumption patterns in relation to their auditory traits and in relation to echolocation characteristics of bats. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between foraging time and auditory characteristics of prey. Families with hearing organs correspond to the orders Lepidoptera and Orthoptera. We registered 20 families of Lepidoptera and 5 of Orthoptera-7 and 3 with hearing organs, respectively. Of these orders, families lacking ears were recorded in the diet of a few bat species. Our results support the allotonic frequency hypothesis predicting a difference in emission frequency intervals between predator and prey. However, we found that the consumption of earless moths is less frequent and is related to diurnal and twilight activity-hence, their consumption is limited to bat species foraging early. Results indicate bats feed on arthropod prey successfully despite the ultrasonic hearing ability of the prey. These results may be due to counteradaptations that allow maintenance of an asymmetric arms race between bats and eared insects that favors the predator.

Bats constitute an attractive group of mammalian species for comparative studies, given their large diversity in behavioural phenotypes, brain morphology, and array of specialised traits. Currently, the order Chiroptera contains over 1,450 species within 21 families and spans ca. 65 million years of evolution. To date, 194 Neotropical bat species (ca. 13% of the total number of species around the world) have been recorded in Central America. This study includes qualitative and quantitative macromorphological descriptions of the brains of 12 species from six families of Neotropical bats. These analyses, which include histological neuronal staining of two species from different families (Phyllostomus hastatus and Saccopteryx bilineata), show substantial diversity in brain macromorphology including brain shape and size, exposure of mesencephalic regions, and cortical and cerebellar fissure depth. Brain macromorphology can in part be explained by phylogeny as species within the same family are more similar to each other. However, macromorphology cannot be explained by evolutionary time alone as brain differences between some phyllostomid bats are larger than between species from the family Emballonuridae despite being of comparable diverging distances in the phylogenetic tree. This suggests that faster evolutionary changes in brain morphology occurred in phyllostomids - although a larger number of species needs to be studied to confirm this. Our results show the rich diversity in brain morphology that bats provide for comparative and evolutionary studies.","[Van Tussenbroek, Ine Alvarez; Vernes, Sonja C.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Queens Terrace, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland; [Van Tussenbroek, Ine Alvarez; Vernes, Sonja C.] Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Wundtlaan 1, NL-6525 XD Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Van Tussenbroek, Ine Alvarez; Ten Cate, Carel J.] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, POB 9505, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Knornschild, Mirjam; Nagy, Martina] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Naturkunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Knornschild, Mirjam] Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Knornschild, Mirjam] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado Postal 0843-03092, Panama City, Panama",University of St Andrews; Max Planck Society; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leibniz Institut fur Evolutions und Biodiversitatsforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Vernes, SC (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Queens Terrace, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland.;Vernes, SC (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Wundtlaan 1, NL-6525 XD Nijmegen, Netherlands.",scv1@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Nagy, Martina/D-2636-2012; Vernes, Sonja/E-8454-2012","Vernes, Sonja/0000-0003-0305-4584",UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship [1129(MR/T021985/1)]; ERC Consolidator Grant [101001702]; Max Planck Research Group - Max Planck Society; European Research Council (ERC) [101001702] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); ERC Consolidator Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); Max Planck Research Group - Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Prof. Constance Scharff who contributed to the sample collection of animals and tissues used in this study.

Most bat species rely on life history traits characterised by high adult survival (associated with greater longevity) and low reproduction rates (hence slow population growth rates). Therefore, road kills are expected to negatively affect local abundance and bat population dynamics. Bat overpasses are among the proposed improvements intended to increase bat flight height to reduce collisions, but their effectiveness has rarely been tested. In this study, we performed a before-after analysis to assess the effectiveness of one bat overpass on bat flight height. We used a novel approach, the bat tracking toolbox (BTT), to reconstruct bat flight paths from thermal videos. We obtained 268 bat flight paths and our results showed that the flight height of bats increased significantly after the installation of the bat overpass. Considering that bat overpasses can help in some situations to increase habitat connectivity and reduce the collision risk, this mitigation measure needs to be further investigated in different contexts of road construction and/or road requalification.","[Claireau, Fabien; Kerbiriou, Christian; Julien, Jean-Francois; Machon, Nathalie; Bas, Yves] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat CESCO, CP 135,57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France; [Claireau, Fabien; Puechmaille, Sebastien J.] Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Soldmann Str 14, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Claireau, Fabien; Charton, Flavien; Braga, Cedric De Almeida; Ferraille, Thibaut; Allegrini, Benjamin] Naturalia Environm, Site Agroparc,20 Rue Lawrence Durell,BP 31 285, F-84911 Avignon 9, France; [Kerbiriou, Christian] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Stn Biol Marine Concarneau, BP 225,Pl Croix, F-29182 Concarneau, France; [Puechmaille, Sebastien J.] Univ Montpellier, ISEM, CNRS, EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Bas, Yves] Univ Montpellier, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS,UMR 5175,Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut CEFE, Montpellier, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Sorbonne Universite; Universitat Greifswald; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier,"Claireau, F (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat CESCO, CP 135,57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France.;Claireau, F (corresponding author), Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Soldmann Str 14, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",f.claireau@naturalia-envrionnement.fr,"Machon, Nathalie/LKK-8344-2024; Puechmaille, Sebastien/D-1612-2010","Puechmaille, Sebastien/0000-0001-9517-5775",Naturalia Environnement; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [2015/0893],Naturalia Environnement; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We would like to sincerely thank our technical partners, especially Cedric Heurtebise, Claire Mestre and Philippe Chavaren from VINCI-autoroutes.

Bats, the only true flying mammals and natural viral reservoirs, have evolved positive alterations in traits related to both functions of ACE2. This suggests significant evolutionary changes in ACE2 during bat evolution. To test this hypothesis, we examine the selection pressure in ACE2 along the ancestral branch of all bats (AncBat - ACE2), where powered flight and bat - coronavirus coevolution occurred, and detect a positive selection signature. To assess the functional effects of positive selection, we resurrect AncBat - ACE2 and its mutant (AncBat - ACE2 - mut) created by replacing the positively selected sites. Compared to AncBat - ACE2 - mut, AncBat - ACE2 exhibits stronger enzymatic activity, enhances mice's performance in exercise fatigue, and shows lower affinity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS - CoV - 2). Our findings indicate the functional pleiotropy of positive selection in the ancient ACE2 of bats, providing an alternative hypothesis for the evolutionary origin of bats' defense against coronaviruses.","[Guo, Yuan Ting] Northwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yuan Ting; Jiang, Ji-Bin; Zhou, Xin; Hua, Rong; Liu, Zhen] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Ji-Bin; Qiao, Guan-Rong; Zhou, Xin; Hua, Rong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Luo, Rong-Hua] Kunming Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Kunming 650500, Peoples R China; [Luo, Rong-Hua] Kunming Med Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Pharmacol Nat Prod, Kunming 650500, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Chang-Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Models & Human Dis Mech, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhen] Yunnan Key Lab Biodivers Informat, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhen] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Key Lab Genet Evolut & Anim Models, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China","Northwest University Xi'an; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Zoology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Kunming Medical University; Kunming Medical University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Zoology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Zoology, CAS","Liu, Z (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China.;Zheng, CB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Models & Human Dis Mech, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China.;Liu, Z (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Key Lab Genet Evolut & Anim Models, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China.",zhengchangbo@kmmu.edu.cn; zhenliu@mail.kiz.ac.cn,"ronghua, luo/AHI-6289-2022; Liu, Zhen/E-7627-2012; Zhou, Xin/D-3044-2014; Zheng, Chang-Bo/AAO-2507-2020; Guo, Yuanting/GZB-2680-2022","Liu, Zhen/0000-0002-3678-1465; Luo, Ronghua/0000-0001-9173-9991; Jiang, Ji-Bin/0009-0000-5421-5304","National Key R&D Program of China [2021YFC2301300]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [32192422, 32330014, 82200550, 81960662]; Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects [202201AS070058, 202102AA310055, 202101 AT070154, 202301AT070270]; CAS Light of West China Program [xbzg-zdsys-202113]; Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KJZD-SW-L11]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects; CAS Light of West China Program; Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

Fungal EIDs have reduced population abundances in amphibians and bats across many species over large areas. The recent emergence of snake fungal disease (SFD) may have caused declines in some snake populations in the Eastern United States (EUS), which is home to a phylogenetically and ecologically diverse assembly of 98 taxa. SFD has been documented in only 23 naturally occuring species, although this is likely an underestimate of the number of susceptible taxa. Using several novel methods, including artificial neural networks, we combine phylogenetic and trait-based community estimates from all taxa in this region to show that SFD hosts are both phylogenetically and ecologically randomly dispersed. This might indicate that other species of snakes in the EUS could be currently infected or susceptible to SFD. Our models also indicate that information about key traits that enhance susceptiblity is lacking. Surveillance should consider that all snake species and habitats likely harbor this pathogen.","[Burbrink, Frank T.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Herpetol, 79th St & Cent Pk West, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Lorch, Jeffrey M.] US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, 6006 Schroeder Rd, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Lips, Karen R.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Burbrink, FT (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Herpetol, 79th St & Cent Pk West, New York, NY 10024 USA.",fburbrink@amnh.org,,"Lips, Karen/0000-0002-2719-1551",NSF [DEB 1257926]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1632956] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We thank B.

Bats are a diverse order of mammals known to carry lethal viral zoonoses such as Rabies, Hendra, Nipah, and SARS. Consequent targeted research is revealing bats to be infected with a rich diversity of novel viruses. Poxviruses were recently identified in bats and the settings in which they were found were dramatically different. Here, we review the natural history of poxviruses in bats and highlight the relationship of the viruses to each other and their context in the Poxviridae family. In addition to considering the zoonotic potential of these viruses, we reflect on the broader implications of these findings.

Predicting key sources of these outbreaks requires an understanding of the factors that explain pathogen diversity in reservoir species. Comparative methods are powerful tools for understanding variation in pathogen diversity and rely on correcting for phylogenetic relatedness among reservoir species. We reanalysed a previously published dataset, examining the relative effects of species' traits on patterns of viral diversity in bats and rodents. We expanded on prior work by using more highly resolved phylogenies for bats and rodents and incorporating a phylogenetically controlled principal components analysis. For rodents, sympatry and torpor use were important predictors of viral richness and, as previously reported, phylogeny had minimal impact in models. For bats, in contrast to prior work, we find that phylogeny does have an effect in models. Patterns of viral diversity in bats were related to geographical distribution (i.e. latitude and range size) and life history (i.e. lifespan, body size and birthing frequency). However, the effects of these predictors were marginal relative to citation count, emphasizing that the ability to accurately assess reservoir status largely depends on sampling effort and highlighting the need for additional data in future comparative studies.","[Guy, Cylita; Thiagavel, Jeneni; Mideo, Nicole; Ratcliffe, John M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Guy, Cylita; Thiagavel, Jeneni; Ratcliffe, John M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Guy, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.;Guy, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",cylita.guy@mail.utoronto.ca,"Mideo, Nicole/F-4520-2010","Mideo, Nicole/0000-0002-8719-3620; Guy, Cylita/0000-0002-5344-8971",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Graduate Scholarship; ACM SIGHPC/Intel Computational and Data Science Fellowship,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Ontario Graduate Scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); ACM SIGHPC/Intel Computational and Data Science Fellowship,"Financial support for this project came from J.M.R.'s & N.M.'s Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada grants, J.T.'s Ontario Graduate Scholarship and C.G.'s ACM SIGHPC/Intel Computational and Data Science Fellowship.",,74,19,22,0,19,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,,,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

Echo classification is essential for bats' everyday life; for instance, it enables bats to use acoustical landmarks for navigation and to recognize food sources from other objects. Most of the research of echo based object classification in echo-locating bats was done in the context of simple artificial objects. These objects might represent prey, flower, or fruit and are characterized by simple echoes with a single up to several reflectors. Bats, however, must also be able to use echoes that return from complex structures such as plants or other types of background. Such echoes are characterized by superpositions of many reflections that can only be described using a stochastic statistical approach. Scientists have only lately started to address the issue of complex echo classification by echo-locating bats. Some behavioral evidence showing that bats can classify complex echoes has been accumulated and several hypotheses have been suggested as to how they do so. Here, we present a first review of this data. We raise some hypotheses regarding possible interpretations of the data and point out necessary future directions that should be pursued.","[Yovel, Yossi] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Franz, Matthias O.] Univ Appl Sci, Fac Informat, Constance, Germany; [Yovel, Yossi; Stilz, Peter; Schnitzler, Hans-Ulrich] Univ Tubingen, Inst Neurobiol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany",Weizmann Institute of Science; HTWG Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Yovel, Y (corresponding author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",yossiyovel@hotmail.com,,"Yovel, Yossi/0000-0001-5429-9245","Graduiertenkolleg Neurobiologie; German Science Foundation [SCHN 138/27-1]; University of Applied Sciences at Konstanz, Germany; European Union [MEST-CT-2004-504321]; [SFB 550]","Graduiertenkolleg Neurobiologie; German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Applied Sciences at Konstanz, Germany; European Union(European Union (EU));","We would like to thank R.

Recent indices of similarity among communities incorporate not only information on species presence and abundance but also information on how similar species are in their traits and how closely related they are in terms of taxonomy or phylogeny. Towards this aim, trait-based, taxonomic or phylogenetic similarities among species have been defined and bounded between 0 (species are maximally distinct) and 1 (species are similar). A required property for an index of similarity between two communities is that it must provide minimum similarity (0) where communities have maximally distinct species, as well as maximum similarity (1) where communities are equivalent in their trait, taxonomic or phylogenetic compositions. Here, I developed a new ordination methodology that conforms to the requirement: double similarity principal component analysis (DSPCA). DSPCA summarizes multidimensional trait-based, taxonomic or phylogenetic similarities among communities into orthogonal axes. The species that drive each similarity pattern can be identified together with their traits or with their taxonomic or phylogenetic positions. I applied this methodology to theoretical examples and to empirical data sets on bird and bat communities to illustrate key properties of DSPCA. I compared the results obtained with DSPCA with those provided by related approaches. Theoretical and empirical case studies highlight the following additional properties of DSPCA: (i) axes are orthogonal and identify independent (dis)similarity patterns between communities; (ii) the more functionally, taxonomically or phylogenetically similar communities are, the closer they are on an axis; (iii) the coordinate of a species on an axis expresses how representative the species is of the pattern identified by the axis; and (iv) a species is representative of x communities if the functional, taxonomic or phylogenetic characteristics of this species are very common within each of these x communities. DSPCA is an efficient approach to visualize functional, taxonomic and phylogenetic similarities between communities. It is also a useful alternative to recent methods dedicated to phylogenetic diversity patterns. It will be an asset for all studies that aim to compare functional, taxonomic, genetic and phylogenetic diversity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine this, we used acoustic surveys to monitor insectivorous bat activity in urban bushland and at two day-roosts of Miniopterus orianae oceanensis between September 2013 and August 2014. Day-roosts were also assessed for potential as swarming sites and monthly estimates of colony size were made at one of these, while radio-tracking was used to identify additional roosts. Acoustic surveys identified seven species, with Mi. o. oceanensis and Chalinolobus gouldii most commonly recorded. Nightly species richness was lower in winter than in other seasons, while total bat activity was greatest in autumn, reflecting increased activity by C. gouldii and Mi. o. oceanensis in this season. One Mi. o. oceanensis day-roost was used from autumn to early spring, with numbers of bats increasing from 50 to 300 and high fidelity shown to this site by radio-tagged bats in autumn, while nightly activity at another day-roost was suggestive of swarming. Seasonal differences in bat activity were species-specific and, for Mi. o. oceanensis, corresponded to changes in population size as bats migrated to and from Sydney to meet reproductive and overwintering requirements. We recommend urban bat monitoring programs sample multiple seasons to adequately document trends in activity for all bat species.","[Gonsalves, Leroy; Law, Bradley] NSW Dept Ind Lands & Forestry, Forest Sci, Locked Bag 5123, Parramatta, NSW 2124, Australia",,"Gonsalves, L (corresponding author), NSW Dept Ind Lands & Forestry, Forest Sci, Locked Bag 5123, Parramatta, NSW 2124, Australia.",leroy.gonsalves@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Law, Brad/IAQ-8054-2023","Law, Bradley/0000-0002-3991-3865",North Sydney Council,North Sydney Council,"We thank North Sydney Council for funding the study.

Current views about the predominance of generalization of pollination systems have stimulated controversy concerning the validity of pollination syndromes. In order to assess the extent to which floral characters reflect selection by the most important pollinators we evaluated pollination syndromes in a florally diverse plant group, the tribe Gesnerieae, a monophyletic plant radiation from the Antillean islands. 2. The study species include representatives of three groups of floral phenotypes, two of which chiefly correspond to ornithophilous and chiropterophilous syndromes. The third group includes subcampanulate flowers (characterized by a corolla constriction above the nectar chamber) with combinations of traits not fitting classic pollination syndromes. 3. Pollination systems were characterized for 19 Gesnerieae species in five Antillean islands between 2003 and 2007 and supplemented with observations of four Gesneriaceae species from Costa Rica. Pollinator visitation and frequency of contact with anthers or stigmas were used to calculate an index of pollinator importance. Eleven floral traits including morphology, phenology and rewards were used to assess clustering patterns in phenotype space. 4. Multidimensional scaling analysis of floral traits resulted in two clusters comprising: (i) tubular, red to yellow-flowered species with diurnal anthesis, (ii) bell-shaped-flowered species; two groups of floral phenotypes were evident within the latter cluster, campanulate nocturnal and subcampanulate flowers. Correlations between pollinator importance values and floral axes revealed strong associations with the expected pollinators, hummingbirds for tubular flowers, and bats for campanulate flowers; subcampanulate-flowered species had generalized pollination systems including bats, hummingbirds and insects. Discriminant analysis of the multivariate set of floral traits correctly classified 19 out of 23 species into the predicted pollination categories. 5. Synthesis. This study provides support for classic hummingbird and bat pollination syndromes, demonstrating the importance of pollinator-mediated selection in the floral diversification of Antillean Gesnerieae. However, there was evidence for generalized pollination systems in species characterized by a unique morphological trait (corolla constriction), but with variable combinations of other floral traits. These findings suggests that floral phenotypes might also evolve under selection by various functional groups of pollinators, and underscores the importance of considering the presence and effectiveness of all floral visitors in pollination studies.","[Marten-Rodriguez, Silvana; Fenster, Charles B.] Univ Maryland, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Marten-Rodriguez, Silvana] Herbario Univ Costa Rica, Escuela Biol, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Almarales-Castro, Abel] Ctr Oriental Ecosistemas & Biodiversidad BIOECO, Museo Hist Nat Tomas Romay, Santiago De Cuba, Cuba; [Fenster, Charles B.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Martén-Rodríguez, S (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",smartenr@gmail.com,"MARTEN-RODRIGUEZ, SILVANA/E-1574-2015","MARTEN-RODRIGUEZ, SILVANA/0000-0003-1810-4759; Almarales-Castro, Abel/0000-0002-2058-3050",American Gloxinia and Gesneria Society; Explorers Club-Washington Group; Graduate Woman in Science; Sigma Xi; University of Maryland; NSF [DDIG 0710196],American Gloxinia and Gesneria Society; Explorers Club-Washington Group; Graduate Woman in Science; Sigma Xi; University of Maryland; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Authors are grateful to T.

Bats are of particular interest for studies of mating systems as they are thought to exhibit a greater diversity in mating systems than any other mammalian order, and thus make great models for improving our fundamental understanding of causes and consequences of social organisation. Here, we review the current knowledge of bat mating systems. Our analyses show that research on bat mating systems has not kept pace with research on bats in general and that traditional typologies do not accommodate the mating system of several species. Therefore, we propose an alternative, functional framework to categorise mating systems of bats and by extension of other taxa. We argue that mating systems can be classified according to a male reproductive skew continuum, with an increasing skew from monogamy to true lekking. We include an additional category of lek-like mating system along the continuum to account for previous trans-categorical cases that have the appearance of resource defence but are functionally akin to a lek. The new framework has a total of seven categories: promiscuity, monogamy, female defence polygyny, resource defence polygyny, a lek-like mating system, exploded classical lek, and clustered classical lek. Applying this framework to bats reveals that lek mating systems are more prevalent in bats than previously recognised. It is our aim that this review and the proposed framework provide a greater understanding of bat mating systems particularly and provoke research into the factors that shape mating systems across animal taxa more generally. Mating systems play crucial roles in behaviour, distribution, reproductive success, and population dynamics. Bats, known for their diverse mating systems, offer valuable insights into understanding the causes and effects of social organisation, yet research in this area lags behind broader bat studies. To address this gap and provoke further research, a new functional framework is proposed to classify bat mating systems, revealing a higher prevalence of lek mating systems than previously acknowledged.image","[Dorrestein, Annabel; Martin, John M.; Welbergen, Justin A.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Sci Rd, Richmond, NSW 2753, Australia; [Westcott, David] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Land & Water, Atherton, Qld, Australia; [Phalen, David] Univ Sydney, Fac Sci, Sydney Sch Vet Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Rose, Karrie] Taronga Conservat Soc Australia, Australian Registry Wildlife Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Western Sydney University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Sydney; Taronga Conservation Society Australia,"Dorrestein, A (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Sci Rd, Richmond, NSW 2753, Australia.",dorresteinannabel@gmail.com,"Welbergen, Justin/AGN-0091-2022; Dorrestein, Annabel/JFB-3285-2023","Dorrestein, Annabel/0000-0003-3165-6603; Martin, John/0000-0003-2731-9292; Welbergen, Justin/0000-0002-8085-5759",Western Sydney University,Western Sydney University,Western Sydney University,,202,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, the TIB remains silent about functional trait composition and provides no information on the scaling of functional diversity with area, an observation that is now documented in many systems. To fill this gap, we develop a probabilistic approach to predict the distribution of a trait as a function of habitat area and isolation, extending the TIB beyond the traditional species-area relationship. We compare model predictions to the body-size distribution of piscivorous and herbivorous fishes found on tropical reefs worldwide. We find that small and isolated reefs have a higher proportion of large-sized species than large and connected reefs. We also find that knowledge of species body-size and trophic position improves the predictions of fish occupancy on tropical reefs, supporting both the allometric and trophic theory of island biogeography. The integration of functional ecology to island biogeography is broadly applicable to any functional traits and provides a general probabilistic approach to study the scaling of trait distribution with habitat area and isolation.","[Jacquet, Claire; Mouillot, David] Univ Montpellier, UMR MARBEC MARine Biodivers Exploitat & Conservat, Pl Eugene Bataillon,Bat 24,CC093, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Jacquet, Claire] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Jacquet, Claire; Gravel, Dominique] Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mouillot, David] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Kulbicki, Michel] Univ Perpignan, IRD, UMR Entropie, Labex Corail, F-66000 Perpignan, France; [Gravel, Dominique] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Chaire Rech Ecol Integrat, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",Ifremer; Universite de Montpellier; University of Quebec; James Cook University; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); University of Sherbrooke,"Jacquet, C (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, UMR MARBEC MARine Biodivers Exploitat & Conservat, Pl Eugene Bataillon,Bat 24,CC093, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France.;Jacquet, C (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.;Jacquet, C (corresponding author), Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",claire.jacquet@uqar.ca,"Jacquet, Claire/I-5833-2019; Mouillot, David/HCH-5670-2022","Jacquet, Claire/0000-0002-7913-0689",Ministry of Higher Education and Research of France; Canada Research Chair program; NSERC Discovery grant; ANR-FNS project REEFISH [310030E-164294]; SeaConnect project (Fondation TOTAL); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [310030E-164294] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Ministry of Higher Education and Research of France; Canada Research Chair program(Canada Research Chairs); NSERC Discovery grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); ANR-FNS project REEFISH(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); SeaConnect project (Fondation TOTAL); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We thank the CESAB, which enabled the creation of the reef fish data base through the GASPAR program, Valeriano Parravicini for his work on the reef fish database that facilitated empirical analyses and four anonymous reviewers for their detailed comments which significantly improved the manuscript.

Sensory systems play an important role in survival and reproduction, and divergent selection on such systems may result in lineage diversification. Such diversification could be largely influenced by selection in different environments as a result of isolation by environment (IbE). We investigated this process using geographic variation in the resting echolocation frequency of the horseshoe bat species, Rhinolophus damarensis, as a test case. Bats were sampled along a latitudinal gradient ranging from 16 degrees S to 32 degrees S in the arid western half of southern Africa. We measured body size and peak resting frequencies (RF) from handheld individual bats. Three hypotheses for the divergence in RF were tested: (1) James' Rule, (2) IbE, and (3) genetic drift through isolation by distance (IbD) to isolate the effects of body size, local climatic conditions, and geographic distance, respectively, on the resting frequency of R.damarensis. Our results did not support genetic drift because there was no correlation between RF variation and geographic distance. Our results also did not support James' Rule because there was no significant relationship between (1) geographic distances and RF, (2) body size and RF, or (3) body size and climatic variables. Instead, we found support for IbE in the form of a correlation between RF and both region and annual mean temperature, suggesting that RF variation may be the result of environmental discontinuities. The environmental discontinuities coincided with previously reported genetic divergence. Climatic gradients in conjunction with environmental discontinuities could lead to local adaptation in sensory signals and directed dispersal such that gene flow is restricted, allowing lineages to diverge. However, our study cannot exclude the role of processes like phenotypic plasticity in phenotypic variation.","[Maluleke, Tinyiko; Jacobs, David S.] Univ Cape Town, Anim Evolut & Systemat Grp AES, Dept Biol Sci, Cape Town, South Africa; [Winker, Henning] South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat SEEC, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; South African National Biodiversity Institute,"Jacobs, DS (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Anim Evolut & Systemat Grp AES, Dept Biol Sci, Cape Town, South Africa.",David.Jacobs@uct.ac.za,"Jacobs, David/L-9118-2013","Jacobs, David/0000-0002-3243-8571","Department of Science Technology; National Research Foundation of South Africa [GUN 64798]; University Research Committee, University of Cape Town","Department of Science Technology(Department of Science & Technology (India)); National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); University Research Committee, University of Cape Town","Department of Science & Technology and the National Research Foundation of South Africa, Grant/Award Number: GUN 64798; University Research Committee, University of Cape Town",,110,10,11,3,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The most up-to-date information on the terrestrial locomotion concerns the species expressing this type of movement as an integrated component of foraging behavior. Quadrupedal locomotion of other bats remains practically unstudied. This paper presents the results of experimental analysis of four-legged terrestrial locomotion in five species of vespertilionid bats. The study is based on a combination of two methods: two-angle high-speed video recording and animals' trackways and traces analysis. The temporal, metric, and speed parameters for locomotion in different species are estimated. The dependence of the characteristics between each other is proven. This is the first time that such parameters have been studied in Chiroptera. A diagonal symmetry for the pattern of the sequential movement of limbs has been detected, while it involves a wide range of deviations atypical for quadrupedal vertebrates.","[Emelianova, O.

Ectoparasites are prominent examples of this bias, given that their sex ratios vary from strongly female-to strongly male-biased both among hosts and at the metapopulation level. To date our knowledge is very limited on how and why these biased sex ratios develop. It was suggested that sex ratio and sex-specific aggregation of ectoparasites might be shaped by the ecology, behaviour and physiology of both hosts and their parasites. Here we investigate a highly specialised, hematophagous bat fly species with strong potential to move between hosts, arguably limited inbreeding effects, off-host developmental stages and extended parental care. Results: We collected a total of 796 Nycteribia kolenatii bat flies from 147 individual bats using fumigation and subsequently determined their sex. We report a balanced sex ratio at the metapopulation level and a highly variable sex ratio among infrapopulations ranging from 100% male to 100% female. We show that infrapopulation sex ratio is not random and is highly correlated with infrapopulation size. Sex ratio is highly male biased in small and highly female biased in large infrapopulations. We show that this pattern is most probably the result of sex-specific preference in bat flies for host traits, most likely combined with a higher mobility of males. We demonstrate that female bat flies exert a strong preference for high host body condition and female hosts, while the distribution of males is more even. Conclusions: Our results suggest that locally biased sex ratios can develop due to sex-specific habitat preference of parasites. Moreover, it is apparent that the sex of both hosts and parasites need to be accounted for when a better understanding of host-parasite systems is targeted.","[Szentivanyi, Tamara] Univ Debrecen, Dept Evolutionary Zool & Human Biol, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Szentivanyi, Tamara] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Szentivanyi, Tamara] Museum Zool, Pl Riponne 6, CH-1014 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Vincze, Orsolya] Univ Debrecen, MTA DF Lendulet Behav Ecol Res Grp, Dept Evolutionary Zool & Human Biol, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Vincze, Orsolya] Babes Bolyai Univ, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Hungarian Dept Biol & Ecol, RO-400006 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Estok, Peter] Eszterhazy Karoly Univ, Dept Zool, H-3300 Eger, Hungary",University of Debrecen; University of Lausanne; University of Debrecen; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Eszterhazy Karoly Catholic University,"Szentiványi, T (corresponding author), Univ Debrecen, Dept Evolutionary Zool & Human Biol, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.;Szentiványi, T (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",tamara.szentivanyi@unil.ch,"Szentivanyi, Tamara/ABC-2314-2020; vincze, orsolya/AEQ-1159-2022","Szentivanyi, Tamara/0000-0001-8123-0374",Hungarian Eotvos Scholarship - Tempus Public Foundation [MAEO2016_15/76740]; Hungarian Research Fund OTKA [K113108]; European Social Fund [TAMOP-4.2.4.A/2-11/1-2012-0001],Hungarian Eotvos Scholarship - Tempus Public Foundation; Hungarian Research Fund OTKA(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"During manuscript writing OV was supported by the Hungarian Eotvos Scholarship (MAEO2016_15/76740) awarded by the Tempus Public Foundation, and by the Hungarian Research Fund OTKA #K113108.

The Chiroptera Specialist Group of IUCN's Species Survival Commission has produced two Action Plans examining conservation issues for all species and detailing recommendations for action to conserve the most threatened species and habitats. These Plans are aimed principally at key decision makers as well as organisations and individuals who are promoting bat conservation issues. The underlying threat to bats is pressure on resources from increasing human populations that leads to the loss or modification of foraging habitats and roosts. Bats frequently have a negative public image that influences the response to the problems of rabies and vampire bats in Latin America and conflicts between bats and commercial fruit growers in other areas of the world. In some areas bats are persecuted because people are ignorant of the life history of bats and their role in ecosystems, while in other areas bats are overexploited for food. There is also a general lack of information about the distribution, status, biology and ecology of many species. This review examines some of the more general issues relating; to bat conservation. It provides information on bat faunas of all countries worldwide, and on the most threatened species. It highlights the priority areas where action is needed immediately at a global, regional or national level. It highlights in particular the global importance of islands and caves for bats.","Fauna & Flora Int, Cambridge CB1 2TT, England; Winkfield, Plumpton Green, E Sussex, England; Univ Aberdeen, Dept Zool, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Mickleburgh, SP (corresponding author), Fauna & Flora Int, Great Eastern House,Tenison Rd, Cambridge CB1 2TT, England.",simon.mickleburgh@tauna-flora.org; hutsont@pavilion.co.uk; p.racey@abdn.ac.uk,,,,,,,161,293,387,2,152,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0030-6053,,,ORYX,Oryx,JAN,2002,36,1,,,,,18,34,,10.1017/S0030605301000011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0030605301000011,,,17,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,573LY,,,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000176832600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, hundreds of more viruses are described without any information on zoonotic potential. We discuss important characteristics of bats including bat biology, evolution, distribution and ecology that not only make them unique among most mammals but also contribute to their potential as viral reservoirs. The detection of a virus in bats does not imply that spillover will occur and several biological, ecological and anthropogenic factors play a role in such an event. We summarize and critically analyse the current knowledge on African bats as reservoirs for corona-, filo-, paramyxo- and lyssaviruses. We highlight that important information on epidemiology, bat biology and ecology is often not available to make informed decisions on zoonotic spillover potential. Even if knowledge gaps exist, it is still important to recognize the role of bats in zoonotic disease outbreaks and implement mitigation strategies to prevent exposure to infectious agents including working safely with bats. Equally important is the crucial role of bats in various ecosystem services. This necessitates a multidisciplinary One Health approach to close knowledge gaps and ensure the development of responsible mitigation strategies to not only minimize risk of infection but also ensure conservation of the species.","[Markotter, W.; Coertse, J.; De Vries, L.; Geldenhuys, M.; Mortlock, M.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Med Virol, Ctr Viral Zoonoses, Fac Hlth Sci, POB 323, ZA-0007 Pretoria, Arcadia, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Markotter, W (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Med Virol, Ctr Viral Zoonoses, Fac Hlth Sci, POB 323, ZA-0007 Pretoria, Arcadia, South Africa.",wanda.markotter@up.ac.za,"Coertse, Jessica/AAJ-6891-2020; Markotter, Wanda/A-2129-2010; Geldenhuys, Marike/AAL-4868-2020","Markotter, Wanda/0000-0002-7550-0080; Coertse, Jessica/0000-0002-8376-6508; Geldenhuys, Marike/0000-0003-4005-118X; Mortlock, Marinda/0000-0001-9286-1040",South African Research Chair initiative of the Department of Science and Innovation; National Research Foundation of South Africa [98339],South African Research Chair initiative of the Department of Science and Innovation; National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),This work is based on research supported by the South African Research Chair initiative (held by Professor Wanda Markotter) of the Department of Science and Innovation and administered by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant No. 98339).,,171,40,41,1,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

Many substrateg-leaning species depend primarily on prey-generated noise to hunt. Use of echolocation is limited to general orientation and obstacle avoidance. This foraging strategy involves a different set of selective pressures on morphology, behavior, and auditory system organization of bats compared to the use of echolocation for both hunting and navigation. Gleaning likely evolved to hunt in cluttered environments and/or as a counter-strategy to reduce detection by eared prey. Gleaning bats simultaneously receive streams of echoes from obstacles and prey-generated noise, and have to segregate these acoustic streams to attend to one or both. Not only do these bats have to be exquisitely sensitive to the soft, low frequency sounds produced by walking/rustling prey, they also have to precisely localize these sounds. Gleaners typically use low intensity echolocation calls. Such stealth echolocation requires a nervous system that is attuned to low intensity sound processing. In addition, landing on the ground to hunt may bring gleaners in close proximity to venomous prey. In fact, at least 2 gleaning bat species are known to hunt highly venomous scorpions. While a number of studies have addressed adaptations for echolocation in bats that hunt in the air, very little is known about the morphological, behavioral, and neural specializations for gleaning in bats. This review highlights the novel insights gleaning bats provide into bat evolution, particularly auditory pathway organization and ion channel structure/function relationships. Gleaning bats are found in multiple families, suggesting convergent evolution of specializations for gleaning as a foraging strategy. However, most of this review is based on recent work on a single species - the pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) - symptomatic of the fact that more comparative work is needed to identify the mechanisms that facilitate gleaning behavior.

The distribution patterns of European bat species differ between species. In this paper we seek to explain which life history traits, or interrelations between traits, can best explain observed differences in the distribution patterns of bats. Traits are interrelated and sometimes involve trade-offs, implying that a change in one trait may have positive or negative consequences for other traits. We describe the main morphological, physiological and ecological adaptations of insectivorous European bat species. We make pair-wise relations between traits, indicating the interrelations between traits, in terms of possible trade-offs. We relate the consequences of these trade-offs to the distribution maps of the species, focusing on the traits relevant for southern and northern distribution limits. We found coarse patterns that might indicate the distribution of related species are a consequence of their physiological, morphological and ecological adaptations and the interrelations between these adaptations. Hence, we think life-history strategies can be used to explain differences in species distribution. The method presented in this paper might also be useful for other mammal groups with a high species diversity, such as Rodentia and Soricidae.","[Haarsma, Anne-Jifke; Siepel, Henk] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Ctr Ecosyst Studies, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Siepel, Henk] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Anim Ecol & Ecophys Grp, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Haarsma, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Ctr Ecosyst Studies, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",ahaarsma@dds.nl,"Siepel, Henk/Q-8145-2019",,,,,,137,8,9,0,28,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1570-7555,1570-7563,,ANIM BIOL,Anim.

Bats might compete for key resources, and cases of exaggerated divergence of resource-related characters or trait overdispersion in bat assemblages are often explained in terms of current or past interspecific competition. However, other pressures leading to patterns that mimic the outcome of competition cannot always be ruled out. We present the state of knowledge on IC among bats, providing a critical evaluation of the information available and identifying open questions and challenges. We reviewed 100 documents addressing potential or actual IC in bats and categorised them in terms of the resource for which bats compete (food, foraging habitat, roosts, water, and acoustic space). We also examined the ecomorphological and behavioural traits considered therein to highlight responses to IC or niche partitioning. We found that: although resources should be limiting in order for competition to occur, this is seldom tested; sympatry is sometimes taken as synonymous of syntopy (yet sympatric species that are not syntopic will never experience competition); comparisons between sympatry and allopatry are rare; and testing of objective criteria exploring the existence of niche partitioning or character displacement is not commonly adopted. While morphological examination of food remains in droppings has often led to coarse-grained analysis that proved insufficient to establish the occurrence of food niche overlap or partitioning, new frontiers are being opened by state-of-the-art molecular dietary analysis. A better understanding of IC in bats is paramount, since distributional changes leading to novel bat assemblages driven by climate change are already taking place, and the dramatic decline in insect availability, as well as the global loss or alteration of foraging habitat, may generate new competitive interactions or exacerbate existing interactions in the Anthropocene, and into the future.","[Salinas-Ramos, Valeria B.; Ancillotto, Leonardo; Bosso, Luciano; Russo, Danilo] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Wildlife Res Unit, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy; [Sanchez-Cordero, Victor] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, Lab Sistemas Informac Geog, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",University of Naples Federico II; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Russo, D (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Wildlife Res Unit, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy.",valeria.salinasramos@unina.it; leonardo.ancillotto@unina.it; luciano.bosso@unina.it; victor@ib.unam.mx; danrusso@unina.it,"Salinas-Ramos, Valeria/AAK-3597-2021","Bosso, Luciano/0000-0002-9472-3802; Salinas-Ramos, Valeria B./0000-0002-3854-6637; Russo, Danilo/0000-0002-1934-7130",CONACYT scholarship [294178],CONACYT scholarship(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),We thank Henry Schofield and Tom Kitching for providing information about IC in rhinolophids and Clara Marcela Salinas Ramos for helping with the figures.

Although some authors found no modular pattern of these morphological structures in mammals, we discovered that traits integration in R. ferrumequinum is not uniform throughout the mandible and cranium, but structured into two distinct modules. Allometry does not affect mandibular and cranial modularity in R. ferrumequinum probably as a result of the low fraction of shape variation explained by size. Observed at the static level, mandible and cranium modularity in this species could be either functional or developmental or both, but we cannot rule out a genetic nature for underlying mandibular and cranial trait interactions. Evolutionary modularity among related taxa is influenced by genetic and functional modularity. Therefore, future studies on cranial integration and modularity at multiple levels of variation may shed more light on these important features of morphological variability in bats, including R. ferrumequinum.","[Jojic, Vida; Budinski, Ivana; Blagojevic, Jelena; Vujosevic, Mladen] Univ Belgrade, Inst Biol Res Sinisa Stankovic, Dept Genet Res, Bulevar Despota Stefano 142, Belgrade 11060, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Jojic, V (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Inst Biol Res Sinisa Stankovic, Dept Genet Res, Bulevar Despota Stefano 142, Belgrade 11060, Serbia.",vjojic@ibiss.bg.ac.rs,"Blagojević, Jelena/B-4593-2008; Budinski, Ivana/L-5470-2019; Vujosevic, Mladen/C-3707-2016","Budinski, Ivana/0000-0001-8834-4200; Jojic, Vida/0000-0001-5070-7192; Blagojevic, Jelena/0000-0001-7102-5510; Vujosevic, Mladen/0000-0002-5577-4455","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of Serbia [173003]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","The authors thank Milan Paunovic from the Natural History Museum (Belgrade, Serbia) for access to the museum collection.

In addition, we provide an up-to-date list of bat species in China. We retrieved 594 publications related to bats in China, nearly half were written in Mandarin. At least 147 bat species are present in China, which places it among the most bat-rich countries in the world. There was a significant positive trend on the number of publications, from 12.5 annual average in 2000-2005 to 46.5 in recent years, reflecting the Chinese economic-scientific development in this century. We found marked taxonomic and spatial biases. Half of the studies in this century focused on Rhinolophus, Myotis, and Hipposideros, and the southern and eastern provinces were the most studied. Systematic/taxonomy and Ecology were the predominant topics post-millennium, whereas only 10 articles have clear conservation-driven goals. Our review shows that the majority of studies were focused on the least concern, cave-dweller species, and on bat-rich provinces. Future projects should address the effects of human-modified landscapes on bat community to define proper conservation actions. We discuss some priority actions and projects that will help to enhance bat protection in China.

We measured 24 habitat variables describing landscape-level, physical, and microclimate characteristics of 13 caves and identified at least three that were useful for predicting winter occupancy by C. townsendii. In univariate analyses, distance to ephemeral water was the only variable that significantly predicted occupancy. Temperature and dewpoint were non-significantly higher in occupied than unoccupied caves. Our index of human disturbance was not associated with winter occupancy as observed in other studies. A multivariate (discriminant) analysis identified three characteristics that significantly and best predicted occupancy by big-eared bats in our sample of caves: (1) greater distance to ephemeral water, (2) the presence of a collapse or constriction, and (3) lower mean height. Although not included in our most-predictive multivariate model, high minimum relative humidity was significantly associated with caves that had a collapse or constriction. Our study suggests that both the landscape surrounding the cave and its physical and microclimate characteristics play a role in the suitability of caves as overwintering sites for Townsend's big-eared bats.","[Gillies, Katie E.] Bat Conservat Int, Austin, TX 78746 USA; [Murphy, Peter J.; Matocq, Marjorie D.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Gillies, KE (corresponding author), Bat Conservat Int, 500 Capitol Texas Highway,Bldg 1, Austin, TX 78746 USA.",Kgillies@batcon.org,,"Matocq, Marjorie/0000-0003-4829-3749",DeVlieg Foundation; National Science Foundation GK-12 Fellowship [DGE 0338184],DeVlieg Foundation; National Science Foundation GK-12 Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank J.

Neurons with band-, short- and long-pass filtering characteristics discharged maximally to a specific sound duration or a range of sound durations. In contrast, neurons with all-pass filtering characteristics do not have duration selectivity. To determine if duration-tuning characteristics of collicular neurons were tolerant to changes in sound intensity, we examined the duration-tuning characteristics of collicular neurons using a wide range of sound intensities. Duration-tuning characteristics examined included the type, bandwidth and slope of duration-tuning curves. Sound intensity delivered within 20 dB of minimum threshold did not affect duration-tuning characteristics of all collicular neurons studied. Sound intensities at still higher levels did not affect the tuning characteristics of two-thirds of collicular neurons but decreased the duration selectivity and changed the duration-tuning curves of the remaining one-third of neurons from one type to another. However, these two groups of duration-tuning collicular neurons were not separately organized inside the inferior colliculus. The biological relevance of these findings to bat echolocation is discussed.","Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Zhou, XM (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",,,,,,,,36,36,38,0,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0340-7594,,,J COMP PHYSIOL A,J.

Bats provide an excellent model to study niche use because they use a wide variety of behavioral, acoustic, and morphological traits that may lead to multi-species, functional groups. Predatory bats have been classified by their foraging location (edge, clutter, open space), ability to use aerial hawking or substrate gleaning and echolocation call design and flexibility, all of which may dictate their prey use. For example, high frequency, broadband calls do not travel far but offer high object resolution while high intensity, low frequency calls travel further but provide lower resolution. Because these behaviors can be flexible, four behavioral categories have been proposed: (a) gleaning, (b) behaviorally flexible (gleaning and hawking), (c) clutter-tolerant hawking, and (d) open space hawking. Many recent studies of diet in bats use molecular tools to identify prey but mainly focus on one or two species in isolation; few studies provide evidence for substantial differences in prey use despite the many behavioral, acoustic, and morphological differences. Here, we analyze the diet of 17 sympatric species in the Chihuahuan desert and test the hypothesis that peak echolocation frequency and behavioral categories are linked to differences in diet. We find no significant correlation between dietary richness and echolocation peak frequency though it spanned close to 100 kHz across species. Our data, however, suggest that bats which use both gleaning and hawking strategies have the broadest diets and are most differentiated from clutter-tolerant aerial hawking species.","[Gordon, Rowena; Ivens, Sally; Littlefair, Joanne E.; Clare, Elizabeth L.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England; [Ammerman, Loren K.] Angelo State Univ, Dept Biol, San Angelo, TX 76909 USA; [Fenton, M.

In the Neotropical phyllostomid bats Carollia, Sturnira and Artibeus, this feeding habit has evolved to become specialized in the core plant taxa Piper, Solanum, and Ficus and Cecropia, respectively. I review the intrinsic factors that promote differences in diet among frugivorous bats of the genera Carollia, Sturnira and Artibeus and the interaction between these and extrinsic factors that affect bat community structure. The intrinsic factors are internal variables associated with fruit selection, body mass and nutrient digestibility that constrain the animals to exploit fruits with different morphological and nutritional characteristics. Intrinsic factors that explain frugivorous bat diet can thus drive community structure in frugivorous bats. The extrinsic factors that affect frugivorous bat community structure are associated with chiropterochoric plant phenology and composition, as well as with human activities that impact food availability. Nutritional diversity in chiropterochoric plants and the digestive capacity of frugivorous bats are key factors in understanding diet partitioning in Neotropical frugivorous bats. These factors are related to food availability and nutrition in bats and could be the major determinants of community structure of frugivorous bats in conserved and disturbed habitats.","[Saldana-Vazquez, Romeo A.] Insituto Ecol AC, Red Ecol Func, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Saldana-Vazquez, Romeo A.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Ecosistemas, Lab Ecol Func, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Saldaña-Vázquez, RA (corresponding author), Insituto Ecol AC, Red Ecol Func, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",romeo.saldana@gmail.com,"Saldaña-Vázquez, Romeo/AAD-2784-2019","Saldana-Vazquez, Romeo A./0000-0002-6442-772X",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) of Mexico [208207]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [208207] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) of Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"I thank the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) of Mexico for scholarship no. 208207; Ellen Andresen, Erich Fischer, Vinicio J.

However, changes in climate and land use may put such interacting patterns at risk by disrupting the occurrences between pollinators and the plants they pollinate. Here, we analyse how the co-occurrence patterns between bat pollinators and 126 plant species they pollinate may be disrupted given changes in climate and land use, and we forecast relevant changes of the current bat-plant co-occurrence distribution patterns for the near future. We predict under RCP8.5 21% of the territory will experience a loss of bat species richness, plants with C3 metabolism are predicted to reduce their area of distribution by 6.5%, CAM species are predicted to increase their potential area of distribution up to 1% and phanerophytes are predicted to have a 14% reduction in their distribution. The potential bat-plant interactions are predicted to decrease from an average of 47.1 co-occurring bat-plant pairs in the present to 34.1 in the pessimistic scenario. The overall changes in suitable environmental conditions for bats and the plant species they pollinate may disrupt the current bat-plant co-occurrence network and will likely put at risk the pollination services bat species provide.","[Zamora-Gutierrez, Veronica; Castro-Castro, Arturo] Ctr Interdisciplinario Invest Desarrollo Integral, Inst Politecn Nacl, Catedras CONACYT, Durango, Mexico; [Rivera-Villanueva, A.

SARS and MERS emerged in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and caused a worldwide pandemic that claimed thousands of human lives, while SADS struck the swine industry in 2017. They have common characteristics, such as they are all highly pathogenic to humans or livestock, their agents originated from bats, and two of them originated in China. Thus, it is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China. Therefore, the investigation of bat coronaviruses becomes an urgent issue for the detection of early warning signs, which in turn minimizes the impact of such future outbreaks in China. The purpose of the review is to summarize the current knowledge on viral diversity, reservoir hosts, and the geographical distributions of bat coronaviruses in China, and eventually we aim to predict virus hotspots and their cross-species transmission potential.","[Fan, Yi; Zhao, Kai; Shi, Zheng-Li; Zhou, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Inst Virol, CAS Key Lab Special Pathogens & Biosafety, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fan, Yi; Zhao, Kai; Shi, Zheng-Li; Zhou, Peng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhou, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Inst Virol, CAS Key Lab Special Pathogens & Biosafety, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Zhou, P (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",yifanfs0224@163.com; chiukal@163.com; zlshi@wh.iov.cn; peng.zhou@wh.iov.cn,"Fan, Yi/HNI-9386-2023; Shi, Zheng-Li/A-1013-2013","Shi, Zheng-Li/0000-0001-8089-163X; Zhou, Peng/0000-0001-9863-4201; Fan, Yi/0000-0002-4117-8433","China's National Science and Technology Major Project on Infectious Diseases [2018ZX10101004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81822028, 81661148058]",China's National Science and Technology Major Project on Infectious Diseases; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The work was supported by China's National Science and Technology Major Project on Infectious Diseases (2018ZX10101004) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Excellent Young Scholars to PZ 81822028 and 81661148058).,,76,347,381,3,104,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4915,,,VIRUSES-BASEL,Viruses-Basel,MAR 2,2019,11,3,,,,,,,210,10.3390/v11030210,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v11030210,,,14,Virology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Virology,HT2OT,30832341,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",Y,N,2025-02-11,WOS:000464402800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although females are responsible for providing parental care in almost all (if not all) bats, there are some species in which the males are larger than the females, and in other species the sexes are similarly sized. It has been proposed that for non dimorphic bat species, some foraging traits might be responsible for the differences observed between the sexes, though, this hypothesis has not been tested formally. Here, we evaluate the sexual size dimorphism of the phyllostomid insectivorous bat Gardnerycteris crenulatum using the morphometric variables of body size and nose-leaf size; the latter is a functional structure that plays an important role in echolocation and determines insectivorous bats' effectiveness in foraging. Our results show that G. crenulatum is a sexually monomorphic species in terms of body size, but it is dimorphic in nose-leaf traits. Females exhibit larger nose-leaves than males, which could increase the directionality of their ultrasound emission and hence improve the females' ability to obtain sensory information. We propose that monomorphic bats could be dimorphic for functional structures related to foraging behaviour as a means to increase their energetic effectiveness.","[Hurtado, Natali] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Ciencias Menc Ecol & Evoluc, Valdivia, Chile; [Hurtado, Natali; Pacheco, Victor] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Museo Hist Nat, Dept Mastozool, Lima 14, Peru; [Sepulveda, Roger D.] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolut, Fac Ciencias, Valdivia, Chile; [Pacheco, Victor] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Fac Ciencias Biol, Lima 14, Peru",Universidad Austral de Chile; Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos; Universidad Austral de Chile; Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos,"Hurtado, N (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Ciencias Menc Ecol & Evoluc, Valdivia, Chile.",natalihm@gmail.com,"Hurtado, Natali/U-8236-2018; Hurtado, Natali/J-5480-2015; Pacheco, Victor/F-5882-2011","Hurtado, Natali/0000-0002-2740-3745; Sepulveda, Roger D./0000-0003-0226-5662; Pacheco, Victor/0000-0002-1005-135X",CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional [2014-63140131]; FINCYT; MECESUP [AUS1203],CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional; FINCYT; MECESUP,"We thank Guillermo D'Elia, Leonardo Bacigalupe and Andrew Beckerman for critically reviewing an earlier version of this paper.

We sampled communities during three seasons, i.e., in autumn, spring, and summer. Using classical taxonomy, 107 taxa/morphotypes were identified in the nine communities. The individual-based functional approach allowed grouping these individuals into 20 functional entities according to their values for 5 traits related to trophic adaptations (cell size, mobility, trophic regime, coloniality, and pelagic/benthic life). Some species (e.g., Prorocentrum micans) emerged in multiple functional entities, showing the importance to consider intraspecific variability. The functional description of phytoplankton communities better reflected the hydrological functioning and the different eutrophication status of the lagoons than the taxonomic approach. Specific functional adaptations were identified in the nine communities. For example, phytoplankton organisms with heterotrophic and potentially mixotrophic abilities occurred when the availability of inorganic nutrient decreased, or when organic matter and small preys were potentially the main nutrient resources. The limitation has also favored small cells highly competitive for nutrients. Using functional indices together with taxonomic description has also helped revealing important aspects of community assembly, such as competitive exclusion in summer.","[Leruste, A.; Villeger, S.; De Wit, R.; Bec, B.] Univ Montpellier, UMR Marine Biodivers Exploitat & Conservat MARBEC, IRD, Ifremer,CNRS, Bat 24,Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France; [Malet, N.] IFREMER, LEPAC Corse, ZI Furiani, F-20600 Im Agostini, Bastia, France",Ifremer; Universite de Montpellier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer,"Leruste, A (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, UMR Marine Biodivers Exploitat & Conservat MARBEC, IRD, Ifremer,CNRS, Bat 24,Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France.",amandine.leruste@umontpellier.fr,"De Wit, Rutger/KBD-4717-2024; Malet, Nathalie/C-8034-2013; Villeger, Sebastien/C-6272-2011","Malet, Nathalie/0000-0003-1922-527X; Villeger, Sebastien/0000-0002-2362-7178","French Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research; European Union's Horizon research and innovation program [641762]; French Agence National de la Recherche through its Labex 'Dispositif de Recherche Interdisciplinaire pour les Interactions Hommes-Milieux (DRIIHM),' programme 'OHM Littoral meditterraneen'","French Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research; European Union's Horizon research and innovation program(Horizon 2020); French Agence National de la Recherche through its Labex 'Dispositif de Recherche Interdisciplinaire pour les Interactions Hommes-Milieux (DRIIHM),' programme 'OHM Littoral meditterraneen'","Amandine Leruste was supported by a PhD fellowship from the French Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research attributed by the Doctoral School SIBAGHE in Montpellier.

Indeed, many species depend on tree microhabitats during their life-cycles for food, shelter, and breeding habitat. Although recent studies have developed a set of definitions and descriptions for tree microhabitats, the relationships between tree microhabitat inventory data and biodiversity remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified relationships among tree microhabitat variables (i.e., the density and diversity of microhabitat) and bird and bat metrics using data from 59 plots in 3 Mediterranean forest ecosystems in France. In each plot, 9 types of tree microhabitats were inventoried: canopy deadwood; woodpecker cavities; non-woodpecker cavities (divided into lower, medium, and upper cavities); Cerambyx cavities; loose bark or cracks; conks of fungi; and ivy. We also assessed structural characteristics (e.g., basal area, stand height), the time since last cutting (i.e., the number of years since the stand was last cut), the number of forest habitats, and the distance to the nearest road. We performed bird and bat inventories in the same plots and we used abundances and a number of bird and bat community indices (e.g., species richness, mean forest specialization). We found that variations in tree microhabitat (more specifically, variations in microhabitat diversity) were a major factor in explaining the abundance and community response of birds and bats. Bird species, including cavity-nesting birds, were most strongly affected by tree microhabitat diversity, while bat species were positively affected by both the diversity of the tree microhabitat and the density of cavities created by Cerambyx spp. Tree microhabitats were better predictors of bird and bat responses than other stand characteristics. Tree microhabitat characteristics provide a reliable measure of ecological niches in forest ecosystems and we propose that these microhabitats be used as indicators for assessing biodiversity in forests.

Changes in life-history traits do not occur independently, as they trade off or co-evolve with other traits. Hibernation is a life-history trait used to cope with periods of low resource availability. The energetic and survival benefits of hibernation depend on environmental conditions. Climate change-induced changes in hibernation patterns are therefore likely to affect other life-history traits through trade-offs. We systematically reviewed the literature to: 1) identify studies testing for associations between climatic variables and life-history traits in mammalian hibernators; and 2) assess variation in responses between species. Air temperature was the most commonly measured climatic variable, and phenology of hibernation emergence was the most commonly studied life-history trait. In most studies and species, emergence date became earlier, litter size increased and the number of interbout arousals increased with increasing air temperature. Despite being considered key life-history traits due to their potential to influence population dynamics, our search returned no studies on the effects of climatic variables on the age of primiparity or on the age distribution of reproduction. Directions of associations between climatic variables and life-history traits often differed between species, and both species- and sex-specific variations occurred in response to climatic variables for some traits. We highlight the importance of long-term, species-specific research, and the need for further studies on indirect effects of climatic cues on co-adapted traits to understand the potential for mammalian hibernators to respond to ongoing and future climate change.","[Findlay-Robinson, Rachel; Deecke, Volker B.; Weatherall, Andrew] Univ Cumbria, Inst Sci & Environm, Ambleside LA229BB, Cumbria, England; [Findlay-Robinson, Rachel; Hill, Davina L.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Sch Biodivers, One Hlth & Vet Med, Glasgow G128QQ, Scotland; [Hill, Davina L.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Cumbria; University of Glasgow; University of Witwatersrand,"Findlay-Robinson, R (corresponding author), Univ Cumbria, Inst Sci & Environm, Ambleside LA229BB, Cumbria, England.;Findlay-Robinson, R (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Sch Biodivers, One Hlth & Vet Med, Glasgow G128QQ, Scotland.",rachel.findlay.robinson@gmail.com; volker.deecke@cumbria.ac.uk; andrew.weatherall@rspb.org.uk; davina.hill@glasgow.ac.uk,"; Hill, Davina/A-9087-2015","Findlay-Robinson, Rachel/0000-0003-2269-6734; Hill, Davina/0000-0001-9085-6192",,,,,104,6,6,10,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,APR,2023,53,2,,,,,84,98,,10.1111/mam.12308,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.12308,,JAN 2023,15,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,A8PP3,,Green Accepted,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000914080200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Additionally, because prey availability, vegetative clutter, and temperature change throughout the year, some species may display seasonal shifts in their nocturnal habitat use. In the Coastal Plain of South Carolina, USA, the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), southeastern myotis (Myotis austroriparius), tri-colored bat (Perimyotis subflavus), and northern yellow bat (Lasiurus intermedius) are species of conservation concern that are threatened by habitat loss. Our objective was to identify characteristics of habitat used by these species during their nightly active period and compare use between summer and winter. We conducted acoustic surveys at 125 sites during May-August and at 121 of the same 125 sites December-March 2018 and 2019 in upland forests, bottomland forests, fields, ponds, and salt marsh and used occupancy models to assess habitat use. The northern long-eared bat and southeastern myotis (i.e., myotis bats) used sites that were closer to hardwood stands, pine stands, and fresh water year-round. We did not identify any strong predictors of tri-colored bat habitat use in summer, but during winter they used bottomland forests, fields, and ponds more than salt marsh and upland forests. During summer and winter, northern yellow bats used sites close to fresh water and salt marsh. Additionally, during summer they used fields, ponds, and salt marsh more than upland and bottomland forests, but in winter they used bottomland forests, fields, and ponds more than upland forest and salt marsh. Our results highlight important land cover types for bats in this area (e.g., bottomland forests, ponds, and salt marsh), and that habitat use changes between seasons. Accounting for and understanding how habitat use changes throughout the year will inform managers about how critical habitat features may vary in their importance to bats throughout the year.

No, or not yet, is the qualified answer based on the evidence available. Although more than 200 viruses-some of them deadly zoonotic viruses -have been isolated from or otherwise detected in bats, the supposed connections between bats, bat viruses and human diseases have been raised more on speculation than on evidence supporting their direct or indirect roles in the epidemiology of diseases (except for rabies). However, we are convinced that the evidence points in that direction and that at some point it will be proved that bats are competent hosts for at least a few zoonotic viruses. In this review, we cover aspects of bat biology, ecology and evolution that might be relevant in medical investigations and we provide a historical synthesis of some disease outbreaks causally linked to bats. We provide evolutionary-based hypotheses to tentatively explain the viral transmission route through mammalian intermediate hosts and to explain the geographic concentration of most outbreaks, but both are no more than speculations that still require formal assessment.","[Moratelli, Ricardo] Fiocruz Mata Atlantica, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Calisher, Charles H.] Colorado State Univ, Coll Vet Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Pathol, Arthropod Borne & Infect Dis Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz; Colorado State University,"Moratelli, R (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Hist, Smithsonian Inst, Div Mammals, Washington, DC 20560 USA.",rmoratelli@fiocruz.br,"Moratelli, Ricardo/A-5735-2013","Moratelli, Ricardo/0000-0003-0942-6633",PAPES; FIOCRUZ; CNPq [407623/2012-4]; CNPq/CsF [202612/2012]; FAPERJ [E-26/111.288/2014]; Smithsonian Institution (USA),PAPES(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FIOCRUZ; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CNPq/CsF; FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); Smithsonian Institution (USA)(Smithsonian Institution),"PAPES, FIOCRUZ, CNPq (407623/2012-4), CNPq/CsF (202612/2012), FAPERJ (E-26/111.288/2014), Smithsonian Institution (USA)",,135,140,162,3,135,FUNDACO OSWALDO CRUZ,"RIO DE JANEIRO, RJ","AV BRASIL 4365, 21045-900 RIO DE JANEIRO, RJ, BRAZIL",0074-0276,1678-8060,,MEM I OSWALDO CRUZ,Mem.

In some cases, individuals remain together for years or even decades and engage in mutually beneficial behaviours among non-related individuals. Here, we summarize ways in which unrelated bats cooperate while roosting, foraging, feeding or caring for offspring. For each situation, we ask if cooperation involves an investment, and if so, what mechanisms might ensure a return. While some cooperative outcomes are likely a by-product of selfish behaviour as they are in many other vertebrates, we explain how cooperative investments can occur in several situations and are particularly evident in food sharing among common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and alloparental care by greater spear-nosed bats (Phyllostomus hastatus). Fieldwork and experiments on vampire bats indicate that sharing blood with non-kin expands the number of possible donors beyond kin and promotes reciprocal help by strengthening long-term social bonds. Similarly, more than 25 years of recapture data and field observations of greater spearnosed bats reveal multiple cooperative investments occurring within stable groups of non-kin. These studies illustrate how bats can serve as models for understanding how cooperation is regulated in social vertebrates.","[Wilkinson, Gerald S.; Adams, Danielle M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Carter, Gerald G.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Bohn, Kirsten M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Johns Hopkins University,"Wilkinson, GS (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",wilkinso@umd.edu,"Wilkinson, Gerald/E-4424-2011","Wilkinson, Gerald/0000-0001-7799-8444; Bohn, Kirsten/0000-0002-8405-3833","National Science Foundation [IOS-0308642, IOS-1311336]; Ford Foundation of the National Academy of Sciences; Animal Behavior Society; Society for the Study of Evolution; American Society of Mammalogists",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Ford Foundation of the National Academy of Sciences; Animal Behavior Society; Society for the Study of Evolution; American Society of Mammalogists,"We thank Jack Bradbury, Christina Riehl, Bill Wcislo and an anonymous reviewer for comments on the manuscript.

Recent discoveries suggest singing by bats might be surprisingly more diverse and widespread than anticipated, but if true then two questions must be addressed: firstly why has singing been so rarely documented among bats, and secondly do bats sing for the same reasons as songbirds? We address the first question by reviewing how sampling bias and technical constraints may have produced a myopic view of bat social communication. To address the second question, we review evidence from 50 years of batsong literature supporting the supposition that bat singing is linked to the same constellation of ecological variables that favored birdsong, including territoriality, polygyny, metabolic constraints, migratory behaviors and especially powered flight. We propose that bats sing like birds because they fly like birds; flight is energetically expensive and singing reduces time spent flying. Factoring in the singular importance of acoustic communication for echolocating bats, it seems likely that singing may prove to be relatively common among certain groups of bats once it becomes clear when and where to look for it.","[Smotherman, Michael; Smarsh, Grace] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Knoernschild, Mirjam] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Anim Behav, Berlin, Germany; [Knoernschild, Mirjam] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Bohn, Kirsten] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Free University of Berlin; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Johns Hopkins University,"Smotherman, M (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",smotherman@tamu.edu,"Knörnschild, Mirjam/C-9401-2011","Bohn, Kirsten/0000-0002-8405-3833; Knornschild, Mirjam/0000-0003-0448-9600","Texas AM University; NSF [IOS-1354381]; German Baden-Wuerttemberg Stiftung, Eliteprogramme; Florida International University; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems [1354381] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Texas AM University; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); German Baden-Wuerttemberg Stiftung, Eliteprogramme; Florida International University; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS))","MS was supported by Texas A&M University and NSF IOS-1354381 while writing this review.

Several ecological or life traits of hosts are expected to explain much of the variability in species richness of parasites. In the present comparative analysis we investigate some determinants of parasite richness in bats, a large and understudied group of flying mammals, and their obligate blood-sucking ectoparasite, streblid bat flies (Diptera). We investigate the effects of host body size, geographical range, group size and roosting ecology on the species richness of bat flies in tropical areas of Venezuela and Peru, where both host and parasite diversities are high. We use the data from a major sampling effort on 138 bat species from nine families. We also investigate potential correlation between bat fly species richness and brain size (corrected for body size) in these tropical bats. We expect a relationship if there is a potential energetic trade-off between costly large brains and parasite-mediated impacts. We show that body size and roosting in cavities are positively correlated with bat fly species richness. No effects of bat range size and group size were observed. Our results also suggest an association between body mass-independent brain size and bat fly species richness.","[Bordes, Frederic; Morand, Serge] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS UM2, Inst Sci Evolut, CC065, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Ricardo, Guerrero] Cent Univ Venezuela, Fac Ciencias, Inst Zool Trop, Lab Ecol & Sistemat Parasitos, Caracas, Venezuela",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; University of Central Venezuela,"Morand, S (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS UM2, Inst Sci Evolut, CC065, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France.",morand@isem.univ-montp2.fr,"Guerrero, Ricardo/HME-2330-2023; Morand, Serge/M-5433-2018","Morand, Serge/0000-0003-3986-7659",,,,,60,34,36,2,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2008,158,1,,,,,109,116,,10.1007/s00442-008-1115-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1115-x,,,8,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,357AX,18679724,,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000259819800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little research has been conducted on bat coronaviruses in South Korea. In this study, bat samples (332 oral swabs, 245 fecal samples, 38 urine samples, and 57 bat carcasses) were collected at 33 natural bat habitat sites in South Korea. RT-PCR and sequencing were performed for specific coronavirus genes to identify the bat coronaviruses in different bat samples. Coronaviruses were detected in 2.7% (18/672) of the samples: 13 oral swabs from one species of the family Rhinolophidae, and four fecal samples and one carcass (intestine) from three species of the family Vespertiliodae. To determine the genetic relationships of the 18 sequences obtained in this study and previously known coronaviruses, the nucleotide sequences of a 392-nt region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were analyzed phylogenetically. Thirteen sequences belonging to SARS-like betacoronaviruses showed the highest nucleotide identity (97.1-99.7%) with Bat-CoV-JTMC15 reported in China. The other five sequences were most similar to MERS-like betacoronaviruses. Four nucleotide sequences displayed the highest identity (94.1-95.1%) with Bat-CoV-HKU5 from Hong Kong. The one sequence from a carcass showed the highest nucleotide identity (99%) with Bat-CoV-SC2013 from China. These results suggest that careful surveillance of coronaviruses from bats should be continued, because animal and human infections may result from the genetic variants present in bat coronavirus reservoirs.","[Lee, Saemi; Jo, Seong-Deok; Son, Kidong; An, Injung; Jeong, Jipseol; Wang, Seung-Jun; Kim, Yongkwan; Jheong, Weonhwa; Oem, Jae-Ku] Natl Inst Environm Res, Environm Hlth Res Dept, Hwangyeong Ro 42, Incheon 22689, South Korea; [Oem, Jae-Ku] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Vet Infect Dis, Coll Vet Med, Iksan, South Korea","National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), Republic of Korea; Jeonbuk National University","Oem, JK (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Res, Environm Hlth Res Dept, Hwangyeong Ro 42, Incheon 22689, South Korea.;Oem, JK (corresponding author), Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Vet Infect Dis, Coll Vet Med, Iksan, South Korea.",jku0623@korea.kr,"Kim, Yong-kwan/LIC-0165-2024","Weon-Hwa, Jheong/0000-0001-8752-607X",NIER of the Republic of Korea [2016-01-01-033],NIER of the Republic of Korea,"We thank Dr. C.W.

Bat-pollinated flowers are commonly associated with nocturnal nectar secretion as well as large amounts of nectar per flower, which is generally diluted and composed mostly of hexose sugars. The nectar traits in bat-pollinated Passiflora species are poorly understood and in this work, we describe these for two such species. We conducted field experiments to assess the nectar secretion dynamics of two species with nocturnal anthesis and similar colours and structures, performed chemical analyses of the sugar components of nectar from these two species, and combined these data with systematic observations of floral visitors. The nectar dynamics of both Passiflora species are similar to those of other bat-pollinated species. In Passiflora mucronata, nectar secretion starts before the flower opens, which occurs around 04h00, with secretion ending after 10h00. Passiflora setacea starts secreting nectar at the time of flower opening, around 22h00, finishing secretion between 04h00 and 06h00. In P. setacea, the final period of anthesis is characterised by active nectar resorption. The different blooming times of these two bat-pollinated passionflowers and the significant differences in their nectar secretion schedules suggest a divergent nectar secretion dynamics: the nectar of P. mucronata is made available only by the end of the bats' foraging activity period, continuing throughout the morning, while P. setacea secretes nectar earlier, with very little overlap in the secretion period between the species. We hypothesise that this segregation in time helps avoid the negative effects from competition for pollinators or pollen interference between flowers with a similar structure, while the outstanding nectar traits and the constant production of flowers throughout the year make these closely related vines important nectar sources for their bat pollinators where they co-occur.","[Avila Jr, Rubem S.] Univ Fed Pampa, Lab Pesquisa Interacoes Ecol, Campus Sao Gabriel,Av Antonio Trilha 1847, BR-97300000 Sao Gabriel, RS, Brazil; [Rocha, Diego Ismael] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Agron, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Nunes, Carlos E.

However, all flying animals must sometimes fly while carrying loads. Load carrying is especially relevant for bats, which experience nightly and seasonal fluctuations in body mass of 40% or more. In this study, we examined how the climbing flight performance of fruit bats (Cynopterus brachyotis; N=4) was affected by added loads. The body weights of animals were experimentally increased by 0, 7, 14 or 21% by means of intra-peritoneal injections of saline solution, and flights were recorded as animals flew upwards in a small enclosure. Using a model based on actuator disk theory, we estimated the mechanical power expended by the bats as they flew and separated that cost into different components, including the estimated costs of hovering, climbing and increasing kinetic energy. We found that even our most heavily loaded bats were capable of upward flight, but as the magnitude of the load increased, flight performance diminished. Although the cost of flight increased with loading, bats did not vary total induced power across loading treatment. This resulted in a diminished vertical velocity and thus shallower climbing angle with increased loads. Among trials there was considerable variation in power production, and those with greater power production tended to exhibit higher wingbeat frequencies and lower wing stroke amplitudes than trials with lower power production. Changes in stroke plane angle, downstroke wingtip velocity and wing extension did not correlate significantly with changes in power output. We thus observed the manner in which bats modulated power output through changes in kinematics and conclude that the bats in our study did not respond to increases in loading with increased power output because their typical kinematics already resulted in sufficient aerodynamic power to accommodate even a 21% increase in body weight.","[MacAyeal, Leigh C.; Riskin, Daniel K.; Swartz, Sharon M.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Swartz, Sharon M.; Breuer, Kenneth S.] Brown Univ, Sch Engn, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University; Brown University,"Riskin, DK (corresponding author), CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, 138th St & Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA.",driskin@ccny.cuny.edu,"Swartz, Sharon/B-9309-2011; Breuer, Kenneth/P-7753-2016","Swartz, Sharon/0000-0001-5762-7435; Breuer, Kenneth/0000-0002-5122-2231; Riskin, Daniel K./0000-0001-8742-8509",Brown University; United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research; National Science Foundation,Brown University; United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Allyson Walsh and the Lubee Bat Conservancy for access to experimental animals and Allyce Sullivan for assistance with experiments.

We investigated roost selection by Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii) using 76 bat boxes, comprising six designs, across three sites in suburban Melbourne, Australia. We conducted monthly surveys for a year and recorded the physical characteristics of each box. Five species of bats were recorded but Gould's wattled bats dominated box occupancy year-round at all three sites. Group sizes ranged from 1 to 58 individuals, with maternity colonies forming over summer. There was little consistency in the use of selection criteria by Gould's wattled bats when choosing a bat box as a day roost, with considerable variability across sites and seasons, highlighting the flexibility in roost site selection by this widespread, adaptable species. Our findings show that bat boxes can be an effective tool for providing supplementary roosts for Gould's wattled bats in urbanised landscapes.

Bats, the second largest mammalian order, rely extensively on vocalizations owing to their nocturnal lifestyle and complex social systems, making them ideal for studying links between vocalizations and consistent behavioural traits. In this study, we developed a new testing regime to investigate whether consistent individual vocalization differences in nectarivorous bats are associated with specific behavioural types. We exposed 60 wild, male Glossophaga soricina handleyi bats to novel and risky stressors and assessed their behavioural and vocal responses. Proactive, exploratory and bold bats were more likely to produce social calls, and among the vocalizing bats, more agitated bats produced higher numbers of social calls. We thus show that bat vocalization behaviour can be indicative of a certain behavioural type, potentially allowing conspecifics to assess personalities from a distance, which in turn could impact subsequent social interactions, group dynamics and reproductive success. Our results, in combination with previous findings in birds, suggest that advertent or inadvertent long-distance broadcasting of personality may be widespread, thus opening up new exciting questions about the links between vocalizations and sociality.","[Schabacker, Theresa; Castiglione, Raffaella; Knoernschild, Mirjam] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Naturkunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Schabacker, Theresa; Castiglione, Raffaella] Freie Univ, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Chem & Pharm, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Snijders, Lysanne] Wageningen Univ & Res, Behav Ecol Grp, De Elst 1, NL-6708 WD Wageningen, Netherlands; [Knoernschild, Mirjam] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Biol, Invalidenstr 110, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Knoernschild, Mirjam] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Luis Clement Ave,Bldg 401 Tupper, Balboa Ancon, Panama",Leibniz Institut fur Evolutions und Biodiversitatsforschung; Free University of Berlin; Wageningen University & Research; Humboldt University of Berlin; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Schabacker, T (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Naturkunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.;Schabacker, T (corresponding author), Freie Univ, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Chem & Pharm, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",theresa.schabacker@mfn.berlin; castiglioneraffaella@gmail.com; lysanne.snijders@wur.nl; mirjam.knoernschild@gmail.com,"Snijders, Lysanne/I-1384-2019","Snijders, Lysanne/0000-0003-0911-3418",Berlin Elsa-Neumann; German Academic Exchange Service ('DAAD-Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst') [91816745],Berlin Elsa-Neumann; German Academic Exchange Service ('DAAD-Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst')(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),TS was funded by the Berlin Elsa-Neumann stipend for doctoral researchers.

Using these traits, we developed models to predict WNS susceptibility of 13 species of western North American bats. Based on models derived from yeast species diversity, only one bat species, Myotis velifer, was predicted to be WNS resistant (i.e., may develop the disease, but with low mortality rates). We also screened yeasts found on western bats for P. destructans-antagonistic properties by spore germination and growth inhibition/competition assays and found the ability of yeasts to inhibit P. destructans in vitro to be strain specific. Similar to results of inhibition assays performed with yeasts isolated from bats in eastern North America, few yeasts isolated from bats in western North America inhibited P. destructans in vitro. Continued monitoring of western bat populations will serve to validate the accuracy of the mycobiome analysis in predicting WNS susceptibility, document population and susceptibility trends, and identify additional predictors to assess the vulnerability of naive bat populations to WNS. IMPORTANCE White-nose syndrome is one of the most devastating wildlife diseases ever documented. Some bat species are resistant to or tolerant of the disease, and we previously reported that certain traits of the skin mycobiome of bat species in eastern North America are strongly associated with resistance to WNS. Predicting which western bat species will be most susceptible to WNS would be of great value for establishing conservation priorities. Based on models derived from yeast species diversity, only one bat species was predicted to be WNS resistant. High susceptibility to WNS would pose a significant conservation threat to bats in western North America.","[Vanderwolf, Karen J.; Campbell, Lewis J.; Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Vanderwolf, Karen J.; Campbell, Lewis J.; Taylor, Daniel R.; Blehert, David S.; Lorch, Jeffrey M.] US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Vanderwolf, Karen J.] Trent Univ, Environm Life Sci, Peterborough, ON, Canada",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Trent University,"Vanderwolf, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Vanderwolf, KJ; Lorch, JM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Madison, WI 53711 USA.;Vanderwolf, KJ (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Environm Life Sci, Peterborough, ON, Canada.",kjvanderwolf@gmail.com; jlorch@usgs.gov,"Vanderwolf, Karen/AAI-6010-2020; taylor, daniel/GYU-3348-2022",,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; U.S. Geological Survey; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada - Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program [W912HQ-16-C-001],U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada - Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program(United States Department of Defense),"We thank the many field biologists that collected samples and coordinated sample collection, including B.

However, most inventories have been mostly made using mist-net sampling and roost search and due to the lack of bioacoustics studies, the bat fauna is certainly subrepresented and biased. The knowledge on distribution and ecology of Brazilian bats is mainly within the Phyllostomidae. Reliable data on bat echolocation calls is the key to improve the knowledge on the distribution patterns and foraging ecology of the remaining eight bat families present in the country. Our work aims to (i) integrate information on echolocation calls of non-phyllostomids occurring in Brazil; (ii) detect regional changes in the acoustic profile of those species; (iii) identify gaps in knowledge both in terms of species and regions sampled; and (iv) to point out which species are acoustically recognizable in a reliable way. Finally, we present a key to supporting the acoustic identification of non-phyllostomids in Brazil. We compiled publications on echolocation calls of Neotropical bat species occurring in Brazil and summarized qualitative and quantitative information of acoustic parameters used in call descriptions. We considered 93 non-phyllostomid bat species to occur in Brazil of which 65 have been acoustically described but for 28 we found no published information. Information on echolocation calls was retrieved from 47 publications and acquired in 17 countries. The use of bioacoustics can be a fundamental tool to expand the knowledge on Brazilian bats and improve their conservation.","[Arias-Aguilar, Adriana; Ramos Pereira, Maria Joao] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Evolucao Sistemat & Ecol Aves & Mamiferos, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Ave Bento Goncalves,9500 Campus Vale, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Hintze, Frederico] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Ave Prof Moraes Rego 1235, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Hintze, Frederico; Bernard, Enrico] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Lab Ciencia Aplicada & Conservacao Biodiveridade, Rua Prof Nelson Chaves S-N,Cidade Univ, BR-50670420 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Aguiar, Ludmilla M.

Many bat species hibernate to conserve energy during winter and like all hibernators they commonly arouse. During these arousals, some bats may undertake activities away from the hibernation site. Systematic ecological studies of the frequency and purpose of winter activity in temperate zone bats of North America are rare and much of the literature involves observations of single individuals or unmarked populations. 2. We review the available literature on winter activity among North American vespertilionid bats to highlight the paucity of data on this subject and to stimulate future research. Due to the lack of repeated, systematic studies on most North American species, the conclusions drawn are general or pertain only to parts of the geographical range of any species. 3. We suggest that winter activity is ubiquitous among temperate zone bats, but the degree and purpose of activity varies greatly between and within species. In general, cave-dwelling bats tend to be relatively inactive compared with tree and foliage roosting bats during winter. 4. Cave-dwelling and tree cavity-dwelling species do not appear to feed, but they do drink and occasionally copulate during the hibernation period. Species that hibernate in foliage or leaf litter are the most active species during winter and may feed and drink throughout winter, although they probably do not copulate because of their solitary nature. 5. We encourage researchers to conduct studies on all aspects of winter activity for North American vespertilionids across wide latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. We suggest studies in the near future be focused on estimating the energetic costs and benefits of winter activity through determination of the frequency and intensity of winter feeding activity and more thorough examinations of movements within and among caves. Studies on common, wide-ranging species have the potential to illuminate large-scale patterns and differences and should be favoured over studies on rarer species.","Indiana State Univ, Ctr N Amer Bat Res & Conservat, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",Indiana State University; University of Regina,"Boyles, JG (corresponding author), Indiana State Univ, Ctr N Amer Bat Res & Conservat, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",jboyles3@indstate.edu,"Boyles, Justin/A-5152-2010",,,,,,108,65,94,3,55,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,OCT,2006,36,4,,,,,267,280,,10.1111/j.1365-2907.2006.00095.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2907.2006.00095.x,,,14,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,126PN,,,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000243526900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Bats, as the only true flying mammals, belong to the Chiroptera, ranking the second order of the mammals with more than 1000 species. They are classified into Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera according to their size and morphological characteristics of the body. Because bats share some basic principles with human in auditory perception, the researches of bats can provide helpful information to understand the hearing of human. The echolocation signals emitted by bats are regular and can be easily imitated to study the mechanism of the signal processing in the central auditory system, especially in the processing of complex acoustic signals, bats is an excellent model animal. Moreover, the biosonar system of echolocation bats with very high temporal and spatial resolution has very important value in bionics, which is a very interesting topic. The study on auditory structure and function of CF-FM (constant frequency-frequency modulation) bats has gone through a considerable time and achieved numerous new understanding, some adaptive mechanisms of the acute auditory system to echolocation behavior are also revealed. Therefore, the research progress in relation to the auditory system and echolocation of CF-FM bats are briefly introduced and reviewed in this article.","[Fu Zi-Ying] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; Cent China Normal Univ, Hubei Key Lab Genet Regulat & Integrat Biol, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",Central China Normal University; Central China Normal University,"Fu, ZY (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",ccnufuzy@mail.ccnu.edu.cn,"Fu, Ziying/N-7127-2013; Xu, Na/JFB-0653-2023","Fu, Ziying/0000-0002-0065-8297",The National Natural Science Foundation of China [31200832]; Fundamental Research Funds of Central China Normal University [CCNU13A05027],The National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds of Central China Normal University,This work was supported by grants from The National Natural Science Foundation of China (31200832) and the Fundamental Research Funds of Central China Normal University (CCNU13A05027).,,60,2,3,4,87,"CHINESE ACAD SCIENCES, INST BIOPHYSICS",BEIJING,"15 DATUN RD, CHAOYAND DISTRICT, BEIJING, 100101, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-3282,,,PROG BIOCHEM BIOPHYS,Prog.

A central question facing bat biologists is the relative importances of roosts and food as limiting factors in the population biology of bats. There is no reason to presume that the answer is the same for all species and the available data suggest intraspecific variation. This question is important for either conservation or behavior and ecology. Eavesdropping on the species-specific echolocation calls of bats has allowed documentation of distribution and habitat use by some bats although variability of calls complicates this picture. Radiotracking and surveys have produced data on use of space by bats. Although foraging areas and roosts are vital resources for bats, the associations between species of bats and habitats are not always clear. The mobility of bats and the low cost of flight together blur the link between bats and particular habitats. Radiotracking demonstrates how mobility gives bats access to mosaics of habitats, partly reflecting their size and flight characteristics, and the scale of habitat availability. For some species, access to mosaics of habitats for foraging is critical. Activities of humans influence the habitats available to bats and can generate feeding and roosting opportunities. The use that roosting bats make of buildings is an obvious example of bats benefitting from activities of humans. Another is bats feeding in the concentrations of insects at lights. Tn promoting the conservation of bats, it is important to consider people's perceptions of these animals, which are colored by the impact of bats on public health. Public interest in bats has vastly outstripped scientific research about them, presenting interesting challenges and opportunities for bat biologists.",,,"YORK UNIV, DEPT BIOL, 4700 KEELE ST, N YORK, ON M3J 1P3, CANADA.",,,,,,,,111,196,267,1,154,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

Bats suffer from several threats caused by anthropization, including exposure to toxic metals and metalloids. We analyzed 75 papers in a systematic literature review to investigate how species, diet, and tissue type impact bioaccumulation. Most studies documented element accumulation in fur, liver, and kidney; at least 36 metals and metalloids have been measured in bat tissues, among the most studied were mercury and zinc. Comparisons with known toxicological thresholds for other mammals showed concerning values for mercury and zinc in bat hair, lead and some essential metals in liver, and iron and calcium in kidneys. Moreover, accumulation patterns in tissues differed depending on bat diet: insectivorous bats showed higher metal concentrations in fur than in liver and kidney while frugivorous species showed higher values in liver and kidney than in fur. Finally, among the bat species that have been studied in more than two papers, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) show values of mercury in hair and copper in liver that exceed the known thresholds; as does copper in the liver of the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus). Most studies have been conducted in temperate North America and Eurasia, areas with the lowest bat species diversity; there is a paucity of data on tropical bat species. This review points out several information gaps in the understanding of metal contamination in bats, including a lack of measured toxicity thresholds specific for bat tissues. Data on trace element bioaccumulation and its associated health effects on bats is important for conservation of bat species, many of which are threatened.","[Giunta, Flavia; Hernout, Beatrice V.; Langen, Tom A.; Twiss, Michael R.] Clarkson Univ, Dept Biol, 8 Clarkson Ave, otsdam, NY 13699 USA; [Hernout, Beatrice V.] Clarkson Univ, Inst Sustainable Environm, 8 Clarkson Ave, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA; [Hernout, Beatrice V.] Exponent Inc, 1075 Worcester St, Natick, MA 01760 USA; [Twiss, Michael R.] Algoma Univ, Fac Sci, 1520 Queen St East, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada",Clarkson University; Exponent; Algoma University,"Twiss, MR (corresponding author), Clarkson Univ, Dept Biol, 8 Clarkson Ave, otsdam, NY 13699 USA.",michael.twiss@algomau.ca,,", Flavia Giunta/0009-0002-9580-0328",,,,,136,1,1,11,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0269-7491,1873-6424,,ENVIRON POLLUT,Environ.

A total of 20% of E nilssonii hibernated in temperatures that were below 0 degrees C. M. daubentonii selected warmer (4.4 +/- 0.1 degrees C) and more humid (88.2 +/- 0.5%) locations than the other species.

Most of M. brandtii/mystacinus, E nilssonii and P auritus hibernated in crevices, while most of M. daubentonii preferred to hibernate on the wall/ceiling. The number of bats found in each hibernaculum was relatively small. The largest number of bats counted was 121, of which 109 were M. daubentonii. M. brandtii/mystacinus tended to gather in larger numbers (up to 83) than E nilssonii and P auritus, which were represented by few individuals (up to 16 and 7, respectively) at each hibernaculum.

Matlo bat lyssavirus (MBLV) was identified in two Miniopterus natalensis (Natal long-fingered) bats in 2015 and 2016, and Phala bat lyssavirus (PBLV) was identified in a Nycticeinops schlieffeni (Schlieffen's) bat in 2021. The distribution of both of these bat species is largely confined to parts of Africa, with limited reports from the Arabian Peninsula. MBLV and PBLV were demonstrated to group with the unassigned and phylogroup I lyssaviruses, respectively. MBLV was most closely related to Lyssavirus caucasicus (WCBV), whereas PBLV was most closely related to Lyssavirus formosa (TWBLV-1) and Taiwan bat lyssavirus 2 (TWBLV-2), based on analysis of the N and G genes, the concatenated N + P + M + G + L coding sequence, and the complete genome sequence. Based on our analysis, MBLV and WCBV appeared to constitute a phylogroup separate from Lyssavirus lleida (LLEBV) and Lyssavirus ikoma (IKOV). Analysis of the antigenic sites suggests that PBLV will likely be serologically distinguishable from established lyssaviruses in virus-neutralization tests, whereas MBLV appeared to be antigenically highly similar to WCBV. Taken together, the findings suggested that, while PBLV is likely a new lyssavirus species, MBLV is likely related to WCBV.","[Viljoen, Natalie; Weyer, Jacqueline; Coertse, Jessica; Markotter, Wanda] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Viral Zoonoses, Dept Med Virol, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Viljoen, Natalie; Weyer, Jacqueline; Coertse, Jessica] Natl Inst Communicable Dis, Natl Hlth Lab Serv, Ctr Emerging Zoonot & Parasit Dis, ZA-2131 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Weyer, Jacqueline] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Microbiol & Infect Dis, ZA-2000 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Pretoria; National Health Laboratory Service; National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD); University of Witwatersrand,"Markotter, W (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Ctr Viral Zoonoses, Dept Med Virol, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",wanda.markotter@up.ac.za,"Coertse, Jessica/AAJ-6891-2020; Markotter, Wanda/A-2129-2010","Coertse, Jessica/0000-0002-8376-6508; Markotter, Wanda/0000-0002-7550-0080; Viljoen, Natalie/0000-0002-9959-2004; Weyer, Jacqueline/0000-0001-9471-2890",The authors would like to hereby acknowledge ReWild (Jane Burd) for providing the bat after it died to be tested in our broader viral surveillance program.,The authors would like to hereby acknowledge ReWild (Jane Burd) for providing the bat after it died to be tested in our broader viral surveillance program.,The authors would like to hereby acknowledge ReWild (Jane Burd) for providing the bat after it died to be tested in our broader viral surveillance program.,,98,4,5,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4915,,VIRUSES-BASEL,Viruses-Basel,OCT,2023,15,10,,,,,,,2047,10.3390/v15102047,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v15102047,,,19,Virology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Virology,W7VC0,37896824,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-02-11,WOS:001093656300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They show preferences for specific body regions on their host bat, which are reflected in behavioural characteristics. In this study, we corroborate the categorization of bat flies into three ecomorphological groups, focusing only on differences in hind leg morphology. As no detailed phylogeny of bat flies is available, it remains uncertain whether these morphological differences reflect the evolutionary history of bat flies or show convergent adaptations for the host habitat type. We show that the division of the host bat into three distinct habitats contributes to the avoidance of interspecific competition of hat fly species. Finally, we found evidence for density-dependent competition between species belonging to the same ecomorphological group.","[Hiller, Thomas; Honner, Benjamin; Tschapka, Marco] Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Hiller, Thomas; Page, Rachel A.; Tschapka, Marco] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Balboa, Panama",Ulm University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Hiller, T (corresponding author), Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.;Hiller, T (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Balboa, Panama.",thomas.hiller@alumni.uni-ulm.de,"Page, Rachel/AAE-4816-2021; Hiller, Thomas/AAX-8786-2020; Page, Rachel/GQQ-2818-2022","Hiller, Thomas/0000-0003-4044-9956; Page, Rachel/0000-0001-7072-0669","German Research Foundation (DFG) [SPP 1596, TS 81/6-1]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This study was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) SPP 1596 Grant TS 81/6-1 to M.T., which had no influence in study design or interpretation of the results.",,56,22,22,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-1820,1469-8161,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,SEP,2018,145,11,,,,,1475,1482,,10.1017/S0031182018000318,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182018000318,,,8,Parasitology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Parasitology,GS5PQ,29565000,,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000443719400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such approaches provide a broader understanding of the ecological and historical factors involved in the formation and maintenance of communities. Metrics such as functional and phylogenetic diversity are crucial as they unveil how communities respond to environmental changes, providing a deeper understanding of their current state and resilience. This goes beyond species richness or community composition, enabling more profound insights into their present condition and resilience. Therefore, analysis in this sense allows accessing differences in the distribution of species, considering different landscape mosaics, and allowing strategic prioritization of conservation initiatives. In this sense, we investigated whether the composition of functional and phylogenetic groups of chiropteran species differs between the Pantanal and Cerrado biomes and various habitat types. We hypothesize that communities with greater conservation integrity are more diverse than communities that suffer anthropogenic influences.MethodsThe surveyed communities include two areas in the Pantanal and two in the Cerrado, with one conservation unit and one that suffers anthropic influence, for each biome. We assessed the composition of bat assemblages by examining functional richness (FRic), functional uniformity (FEve), functional divergence (FDiv), and functional dispersion (FDis). Metrics that reflect phylogenetic richness and divergence were also used, such as phylogenetic diversity (PD), mean pairwise distance (MPD), and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD).Results and discussionOverall, conservation units sustain higher levels of functional and phylogenetic diversity compared to areas with anthropic influence. In the latter, species occupy fewer ecological niches, indicating that bats can persist in degraded environments, albeit the communities support only a portion of the functional groups.ConclusionOur results showed, through analyses across multiple dimensions of functional and phylogenetic diversity, that bat populations are impacted by environmental degradation and fragmentation. Communities in more conserved areas exhibited higher functional and phylogenetic richness, indicating a greater number of occupied niches. These findings highlight the importance of exploring measures of biological diversity and their spatial scales to advance our understanding of biodiversity dynamics and optimize conservation planning for both species and communities.","[de Oliveira, Marcione B.; de Oliveira, Luiz Flamarion B.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Vertebrados, Museu Nacl, Setor Mastozool, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Marcione B.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Museu Nacl, Programa Posgrad Zool, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Marcione B.; Bonvicino, Cibele R.] Fiocruz MS, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Biol & Parasitol Mamiferos Silvestres Reservat, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz,"de Oliveira, MB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Vertebrados, Museu Nacl, Setor Mastozool, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;de Oliveira, MB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Museu Nacl, Programa Posgrad Zool, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;de Oliveira, MB (corresponding author), Fiocruz MS, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Biol & Parasitol Mamiferos Silvestres Reservat, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",oliveira01marcione@gmail.com; lfbolive@mn.ufrj.br; cibele.bonvicino@gmail.com,,,"Sesc Pantanal; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico (CNPq) [400713/2013-6]; CNPq [311712/2021-5, 162273/2018-5]; Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [E-26/210.925/2019]",Sesc Pantanal; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)),"We thank Martha L Brandao, Jose LP Cordeiro, Fabricio Escarlate-Tavares, and Fernanda Trierveiler for their efforts in the field, and Gustavo Staut for his support and permission to work at the Santa Lucia ranch, Brazilian Pantanal.

States of these characters are tabulated as they occur in each of 152 mammalian species, providing data in numerically ordered form, useful for multiple analyses of phylogenetic relationships in programs which take into account variations in several different characters simultaneously. Derived states of each of the nine traits are characteristic of certain restricted, groups of mammals: (1) mirroring of the complete SI body representation in isocortex (anthropoid primates); (2) loss of the accessory olfactory bulbs (sirenians, cetaceans, most bats, catarrhine primates); (3) Rindenkerne, clumps of cell bodies in layer 6 of cerebral cortex (sirenians); (4) posteriorly pointing digits in the SI body representation (bats, both mega- and micro-); (5) equivalent tectopetal connections to the anterior colliculus of one side from both retinas, rather than predominantly from the contralateral retina (primates and megabats); (6) loss of lamination in dorsal cochlear nuclei (anthropoid primates, bats, seals, sirenians, cetaceans); (7) separation of claustrum from cerebral cortex (diprotodont marsupials, carnivores, artiodactyls, perissodactyls, hyracoids, cetaceans and primates), (8) presence of a complete secondary (SII) somatic sensory region of cerebral cortex (therians - all extant mammals other than monotremes), and (9) presence of a distinct external cuneate nucleus among the nuclei of the dorsal columns (all mammalian groups except monotremes and sirenians). Two examples of phylogenetic trees derived from these data are presented. These sample trees maintain the segregation of the monotremes and the marsupials, and the basic dichotomy of placentals seen in our earlier toes based entirely on brain data. They also show: an orderly sequence of bifurcations (rather than the commonly seen multifurcation near the base of the radiation) in the reconstruction of placental relationships; extremes of derivation for the Cetacea, the Chiroptera, and the Sirenia (in concordance with trees based on other data); a ferungulate association of Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, Hyracoidea and Sirenia; and an assemblage of related Dermoptera, Primates, Scandentia, and Chiroptera which in this model also includes Insectivora and Macroscelidea. Analyses based on brain characters can reinforce conclusions based on other data. while at the same time introducing new ideas about relationships. Neural traits provide a source of data independent of those commonly used in phylogenetic analysis, and are extremely valuable for testing old hypotheses and for introducing new ones. They also provide interesting suggestions about convergent or parallel evolution of characters: for example, two characters, loss of accessory olfactory formations and loss of lamination in the dorsal cochlear nuclei, together occur convergently in several lines (bats, monkeys, seals, dolphins and manatees); one common feature in the evolution of these diverse groups is departure from a terrestrial habitat. This is consistent with the functional loss of the accessory olfactory formation, which is activated by airborne olfactory pheromones; it establishes a basis for more informed speculation about the still mysterious role of the dorsal cochlear nuclei in the auditory system.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, NEUROSCI PROGRAM, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA; UNIV WISCONSIN, ZOOL MUSEUM, MADISON, WI USA; UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT ZOOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT PHYSIOL SCI, GAINESVILLE, FL 32610 USA; UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT NEUROSCI, GAINESVILLE, FL 32610 USA; UNIV TENNESSEE, COLE NEUROSCI LAB, KNOXVILLE, TN USA; UNIV TENNESSEE, DEPT MED BIOL, KNOXVILLE, TN USA; UNIV TENNESSEE, DEPT PATHOL, KNOXVILLE, TN USA",Michigan State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT ANAT, A514 E FEE HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,,115,55,60,2,37,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0006-8977,1421-9743,,BRAIN BEHAV EVOLUT,Brain Behav.

Body mass and epididymal distension were positively correlated in young of the year and adults, suggesting that early sexual maturation and reproductive condition during later life are dependent on body condition. Older males tended to be heavier and in better reproductive condition than Younger ones.

In this context, the available species pool is determined in part by historical adaptation to the native ecosystem, but the resulting community structure may be determined principally by the ability of evolved traits to function in the novel context of a human-dominated ecosystem. To investigate the role of human disturbance as a determinant of bat communities, we surveyed assemblages and species occurrence rates in 27 agriculturally dominated landscapes exhibiting a gradient of human-induced forest fragmentation in Indiana, USA. We used multiple linear regression to explore the relationship of landscape environmental variables to species diversity. We then examined the relationship between community structure, evolved species traits and fragmentation conditions across a landscape using RLQ analysis. Overall, species diversity was positively related to the amount of forest and negatively correlated with amount of urban development in a landscape. We also observed a significant relationship between evolved species traits and landscape-level variables that is consistent with globally anticipated trends for bat species extinction risk. Our findings suggest that responses of bat species to human modification of ecosystems on the scale of a few kilometers could drive distributional dynamics at larger spatial and longer temporal scales.","[Duchamp, Joseph E.] Indiana Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Indiana, PA 15705 USA; [Duchamp, Joseph E.; Swihart, Robert K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Indiana University of Pennsylvania; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Duchamp, JE (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Indiana, PA 15705 USA.",j.duchamp@iup.edu,"Duchamp, Joseph/AAE-7710-2020; Swihart, Robert/D-2787-2016",,"Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, U.

Species with high dispersal capabilities are predicted to be less affected by these factors because of their capacity to move more efficiently between islands or habitats, and here we test this idea in bats, the only mammals capable of flight. We conducted mist net and acoustic surveys across 21 islands in the San Juan Archipelago (Washington State, United States) and adjacent northwest mainland to: (i) investigate the effects of island area, distance from mainland, and habitat on bat diversity; and (ii) evaluate whether differences in morphological (body mass, forearm length, wing loading) and ecological (dietary niche breadth, foraging guild) traits among species influence their prevalence across islands. We found that island size strongly influenced patterns of species richness, with larger islands having a greater number of bat species. However, neither island distance from mainland nor any measure of habitat availability was a significant predictor of species richness at the scale of this study. Additionally, we found that dietary niche breadth, as opposed to any morphological trait, best predicted the prevalence of species across the islands. Our results suggest that species with more specialized diets may be more vulnerable to habitat fragmentation, and provide insight into how geographic and ecological factors affect the diversity of insular bat communities, adding to growing knowledge about the role of species traits as mediators of their responses to large-scale landscape structure. As the only flying mammals, bats are a particularly exciting system to test predictions from island biogeography theory, including the effects island characteristics on species diversity. We surveyed bat communities across 21 islands in a near-shore archipelago in Washington State, United States, and report that island size-rather than distance from mainland or habitat quality-best explains bat species diversity. We also find that dietary specialization within an insectivorous niche influences the prevalence of bat species among the islands. Our results provide new evidence underscoring the role of ecological traits in mediating mammal species distributions in fragmented landscapes.","[Santana, Sharlene E.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Life Sci Bldg, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Santana, Sharlene E.] Univ Washington, Burke Museum Nat Hist & Culture, Life Sci Bldg, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Santana, SE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Life Sci Bldg, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Santana, SE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Burke Museum Nat Hist & Culture, Life Sci Bldg, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",ssantana@uw.edu,,,Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program; Friday Harbor Laboratories; Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology; American Society of Mammalogists; Seattle Achievement Rewards for College Scientists chapter; Washington Research Foundation; Experiment.com crowd funding,Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program; Friday Harbor Laboratories; Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology; American Society of Mammalogists; Seattle Achievement Rewards for College Scientists chapter; Washington Research Foundation; Experiment.com crowd funding,"We thank the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program, Friday Harbor Laboratories, the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, the American Society of Mammalogists, the Seattle Achievement Rewards for College Scientists chapter, the Washington Research Foundation, and the donors to Experiment.com crowd funding for financial support.",,104,0,0,15,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

From 2016 to 2020 we radio-tagged 53 adult female silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and tracked them to their day roosts to evaluate roosting habits in a cottonwood (Populus) forest in the floodplain of the Bitterroot River in western Montana. We investigated roost tree characteristics of maternity colonies such as canopy closure, tree size, and decay stage, as well as the daily roost fidelity of tagged bats. Additionally, we marked 55 bats with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to assess interannual fidelity to summer habitat. We tracked bats to 94 unique roost trees. Based on previous studies, we expected silver-haired bat maternity colonies to roost in tall, large diameter trees. We modeled roosting probability as a function of tree height, day of year, and the interaction of these terms. We found bats preferred taller trees earlier in the year, but overall roosting probability decreased throughout the season and tree height had lesser influence on roosting probability later in the year. Bats used tall trees with high canopy closure in early stages of decay during periods of pregnancy and lactation, while the effect of these tree attributes lessened later in the season, perhaps after lactation when energetic constraints were reduced for adult females to prepare for migration by entering torpor during the day. Bats used an average of 5.2 roost trees during the young rearing period and remained in the same roost for an average of 1.5 consecutive days. While daily roost fidelity was low, we documented interannual fidelity to summer habitat from nine individuals. We found silver-haired bat roosting preferences vary with time, are tree-specific, and policies targeting conservation of the species should manage flood regimes to promote cottonwood establishment, height growth, and a mosaic of riparian habitats. Silver-haired bat maternity colonies within floodplain forests occurred in tall trees with high canopy closure in early stages of decay during periods of pregnancy and lactation, while the effect of these tree attributes lessened later in the season. These roosting preferences varied with time and were tree-specific; therefore, policies targeting conservation of the species should manage flood regimes to promote cottonwood establishment, height growth, and a mosaic of riparian habitats. image","[Schwab, Nathan A.; Chesonis, Tessa N.] Tetra Tech, Missoula, MT USA; [Doherty, Kyle; Ramsey, Philip] MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT USA; [Chesonis, Tessa N.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR USA",Oregon State University,"Schwab, NA (corresponding author), 4360 Fox Farm Rd, Missoula, MT 59802 USA.",nathan.schwab@tetratech.com,,"Doherty, Kyle/0000-0002-3742-7839",MPG Ranch,MPG Ranch,"Thank you to MPG Ranch for supporting this work.

We sampled bats in Cote d'Ivoire (2016-2018) living at ecotones between anthropogenic and wild habitats in the Marahoue National Park, a recently encroached protected area, to detect and characterize the CoVs circulating in bats and humans. A total of 314 bats were captured, mostly during the rainy season (78%), and CoV RNA was detected in three of the bats (0.96%). A CoV RNA sequence similar to Chaerephon bat coronavirus/Kenya/KY22/2006 (BtKY22) was found in a Chaerephon cf. pumilus and a Mops sp. fecal swab, while a CoV RNA sequence similar to the two almost identical Kenya bat coronaviruses BtKY55 and BtKY56 (BtKY55/ 56) was detected in an Epomops buettikoferi oral swab. Phylogenetic analyses indicated differences in the degree of evolutionary host-virus co-speciation for BtKY22 and BtKY55/56. To assess potential for human exposure to these viruses, we conducted human syndromic and community-based surveillance in clinics and high-risk communities. We collected data on participant characteristics, livelihoods, animal contact, and high-risk behaviors that may be associated with exposure to zoonotic diseases. We then collected biological samples for viral testing from 401 people. PCR testing of these biological samples revealed no evidence of CoV infection among the enrolled individuals. We identified higher levels of exposure to bats in people working in crop production and in hunting, trapping and fishing. Finally, we used the 'Spillover' risk-ranking tool to assess the potential for viral spillover and concluded that, while there is no evidence to suggest imminent risk of spillover for these CoVs, their host range and other traits suggest caution and vigilance are warranted in people with high exposure risk.","[Lange, Christian E.; Saylors, Karen; Frantz, Jean-Louis; Joly, Damien] Metabiota Inc, 425 Calif St, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA; [Lange, Christian E.; Saylors, Karen] Labyrinth Global Hlth Inc, 546 15TH Ave NE, St Petersburg, FL 33704 USA; [Lange, Christian E.] Kwantlen Polytech Univ, 12666 72 Ave, Surrey, BC V3W 2M8, Canada; [Coulibaly, Julien Kalpy; Ako, Aristide Beranger Ako; Vakou, Sabine N'dri; Koffi, Eugene Kouassi; Manzan, Jean; Bamba, Djeneba; Koui, Stephane Tossea; Dosso, Mireille] Inst Pasteur Cote Ivoire IPCI, 01 BP 490, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Mendelsohn, Emma; Ball, Shannon; Martinez, Stephanie; Daszak, Peter; Laudisoit, Anne] Ecohlth Alliance, 520 Eighth Ave, Suite 1200, New York, NY 10018 USA; [Francisco, Leilani] Henry M Jackson Fdn, 6720A Rockledge Dr, Bethesda, MD 20817 USA; [Kouakou, Valere; Yapi, Cyprien] Natl Agr Dev Support Lab, LANADA, BP 206, Bingerville, Cote Ivoire; [Laudisoit, Anne] Univ Antwerp, EVECO, Campus Drie Eiken Univ pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium","Institut Pasteur de Cote d'Ivoire; EcoHealth Alliance; Henry M.

Specifically, we explore variation in form and function of the bat rostrum and its role in respiration, echolocation, and olfaction in bats, with an emphasis on the noseleaves of nasal-emitting echolocators, as well as how turbinate morphology may be impacted by nasophonation. While our review is not an extensive dive into all that is known about bat noses, our goal is to highlight the diversity we see in form across the order Chiroptera while exploring how function has been shaped by selection, particularly in relation to mode of echolocation signal emission.","[Dzal, Yvonne A.] Univ Fraser Valley, Dept Biol, Abbotsford, BC, Canada; [Gillam, Erin H.] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fargo, ND USA",University of Fraser Valley; North Dakota State University Fargo,"Dzal, YA (corresponding author), Univ Fraser Valley, Dept Biol, Abbotsford, BC, Canada.",Yvonne.Dzal@ufv.ca,"; Dzal, Yvonne/AAA-3220-2022","Gillam, Erin/0000-0001-6707-7780; Dzal, Yvonne/0000-0002-4391-0712",,,,,83,1,1,4,10,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"123 Slater Street, Suite 610, OTTAWA, ON K1P 5H2, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Patterns of bat activity and mortality at wind energy facilities suggest that bats are attracted to wind turbines. It has been more than a decade since a comprehensive review of the various attraction hypotheses was published, highlighting the need to revisit and assess progress in the testing of these ideas. In this review, we discuss the most prominent attraction hypotheses, summarize the current state of knowledge, and briefly outline remaining questions. Identifying the causes of bat interactions with wind turbines is critical to developing effective impact minimization strategies. Patterns of bat activity and mortalities at wind energy facilities suggest that bats are attracted to wind turbines based on bat behavioral responses to wind turbines. For example, current monitoring efforts suggest that bat activity increases post-wind turbine construction, with bats making multiple passes near wind turbines. We separated the attraction hypothesis into five previously proposed explanations of bat interactions at or near wind turbines, including attraction based on noise, roost sites, foraging and water, mating behavior, and lights, and one new hypothesis regarding olfaction, and provide a state of the knowledge in 2022. Our review indicates that future research should prioritize attraction based on social behaviors, such as mating and scent-marking, as this aspect of the attraction hypothesis has many postulates and remains the most unclear. Relatively more data regarding attraction to wind turbines based on lighting and noise emission exist, and these data indicate that these are unlikely attractants. Analyzing attraction at the species-level should be prioritized because of differences in foraging, flight, and social behavior among bat species. Lastly, research assessing bat attraction at various scales, such as the turbine or facility scale, is lacking, which could provide important insights for both wind turbine siting decisions and bat mortality minimization strategies. Identifying the causes of bat interactions with wind turbines is critical for developing effective impact minimization strategies.","[Guest, Emma E.; Stamps, Brittany F.; Fritts, Sarah R.] Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, 601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Durish, Nevin D.] ESE Partners LLC, 5910 Courtyard Dr Suite 170, Austin, TX 78731 USA; [Hale, Amanda M.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Hein, Cris D.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Arvada, CO 80007 USA; [Morton, Brogan P.] Wildlife Imaging Syst, 328 Mech Rd, Hinesburg, VT 05461 USA; [Weaver, Sara P.] Bowman, 133 West San Antonio St 500, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos; Texas Christian University,"Fritts, SR (corresponding author), Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, 601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",eeg89@txstate.edu; bfs27@txstate.edu; nevin@esepartners.com; a.hale@tcu.edu; Cris.Hein@nrel.gov; brogan@wildlifeimagingsystems.com; sweaver@bowman.com; fritts.sarah@txstate.edu,,"Weaver, Sara/0000-0001-5555-5087; Hale, Amanda/0000-0001-9701-0763; Hein, Cris/0000-0003-3040-7998",National Renewable Energy Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC36-08GO28308]; DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Wind Energy Technologies Office,National Renewable Energy Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Wind Energy Technologies Office(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"FundingThis work was authored, in part, by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

While practices characteristic of agricultural intensification tend to erode biodiversity, agroecological farming practices can potentially support biodiversity and enhance pest suppression services. Bats are important predators of agricultural pests, yet little is known about how prescriptive management practices can be used to support bats and their associated pest-suppression services. We investigate how bats use natural habitat and conventional and organic farms in an agricultural landscape, ask which on-farm management practices may benefit bats, and examine how these management practices influence bats by mediating changes in habitat quality. We conducted acoustic surveys at 54 sites in the California Central Coast Region, a productive region with high ecological and economic value. We found higher bat activity in natural habitat compared to farms for total bat activity and clutter-adapted, but not open space bats, and slightly higher bat diversity in natural habitat compared to conventional farms. We found no effect of habitat type on species richness and a weak effect of habitat type on bat diversity, although bat community composition differed significantly between natural habitat and farms. Crop diversification increased the activity of all bat species and clutter-adapted, but not open space bats, regardless of the amount of semi-natural habitat surrounding farms. Both crop diversification and less frequent pesticide applications increased prey biomass, and the activity of clutter-adapted bats was positively correlated with greater Lepidoptera biomass. We suggest that improving habitat quality (increasing abundance of insect prey) through vegetative diversification and/or less frequent pesticide applications offers flexible management options to growers by considering both bat ecology and the constraints of regional agricultural management practices.","[Olimpi, Elissa M.; Philpott, Stacy M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Olimpi, Elissa M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Olimpi, EM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.;Olimpi, EM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",eolimpi@ucdavis.edu,"Philpott, Stacy/M-3486-2019; Philpott, Stacy/F-2330-2011","Olimpi, Elissa/0000-0003-2995-0301; Philpott, Stacy/0000-0002-8338-3806","Annie's Sustainable Agriculture, Berkeley, CA; Bob Berry Fund; Bat Conservation International, Austin, TX; National Science Foundation [DGE-0947923]; University of California, Santa Cruz","Annie's Sustainable Agriculture, Berkeley, CA; Bob Berry Fund; Bat Conservation International, Austin, TX; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of California, Santa Cruz(University of California System)","This work was funded by Annie's Sustainable Agriculture, Berkeley, CA; the Bob Berry Fund; Bat Conservation International, Austin, TX; the National Science Foundation (Grant # DGE-0947923); and the University of California, Santa Cruz.",,70,27,32,5,155,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,1873-2305,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

Yet most of these studies provide only snapshots in time of the parasites discovered. Polychromophilus murinus, a malaria-like blood parasite, specialised on temperate-zone bats is a species that is being 'rediscovered'. This study describes the infection dynamics over time and between host sex and age classes. Methods: For three years we followed the members of three breeding colonies of Myotis daubentonii in Western Switzerland and screened them for the prevalence and parasitemia of P. murinus using both molecular tools and traditional microscopy. In order to identify more susceptible classes of hosts, we measured, sexed and aged all individuals. During one year, we additionally measured body temperature and haematocrit values. Results: Juvenile bats demonstrated much higher parasitemia than any other age class sampled, suggesting that first exposure to the parasite is very early in life during which infections are also at their most intense. Moreover, in subadults there was a clear negative correlation between body condition and intensity of infection, whereas a weak positive correlation was observed in adults. Neither body temperature, nor haematocrit, two proxies used for pathology, could be linked to intensities of infection. Conclusion: If both weaker condition and younger age are associated with higher infection intensity, then the highest selection pressure exerted by P. murinus should be at the juvenile stage. Confusion over the identities and nomenclature of malarial-like parasites requires that molecular barcodes are coupled to accurate morphological descriptions.","[Witsenburg, Fardo; Schneider, Franziska; Christe, Philippe] Univ Lausanne, Biophore, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Witsenburg, F (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Biophore, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",fardo.witsenburg@unil.ch,"; Christe, Philippe/X-4493-2018","Goldstein, Fardo/0000-0001-5674-5114; Christe, Philippe/0000-0002-8605-7002","Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A-120479, 31003A-138187]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [31003A_120479] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"The authors would like to thank all those who helped catching bats in the field, in particular Ludovic Dutoit and Laura Clement.

However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding these antagonistic interactions, especially since diverse factors such as seasonality and host sex can affect their network structures. Here, we explore the influence of such factors by comparing species richness and composition of bat flies on host bats, as well as specialization and modularity of bat-bat fly interaction networks between seasons and adult host sexes. We captured bats and collected their ectoparasitic flies at 10 sampling sites in the savannahs of Amapa State, northeastern region of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite female bats being more parasitized and recording greater bat fly species richness in the wet season, neither relationship was statistically significant. The pooled network could be divided into 15 compartments with 54 links, and all subnetworks comprised >12 compartments. The total number of links ranged from 27 to 48 (for the dry and wet seasons, respectively), and female and male subnetworks had 44 and 41 links, respectively. Connectance values were very low for the pooled network and for all subnetworks. Our results revealed higher bat fly species richness and abundance in the wet season, whereas specialization and modularity were higher in the dry season. Moreover, the subnetwork for female bats displayed higher specialization and modularity than the male subnetwork. Therefore, both seasonality and host sex contribute in different ways to bat-bat fly network structure. Future studies should consider these factors when evaluating bat-bat fly interaction networks.","[Mejia, Paulo; Urbieta, Gustavo Lima; De Toledo, Jose Julio; Viana Dias, Lucio Andre; Carvalho, William Douglas] Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Programa Pos Graduacao Biodiversidade Trop, Macapa, AP, Brazil; [Xavier, Bruna da Silva] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Ctr Ciencias Saude, Programa Pos Graduacao Ecol, Inst Biol, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [de Castro, Isai Jorge] Inst Pesquisas Cient & Tecnol Estado Amapa IEPA, Lab Mamiferos, Macapa, AP, Brazil; [Graciolli, Gustavo] Univ Fed Mato Grosso UFMS, Lab Sistemat Ecol & Evolucao LSEE, Programa Pos Graduacao Biol Anim, Inst Biociencias, Campo Grande, MT, Brazil; [Carvalho, William Douglas] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Terr Ecol Grp TEG UAM, Madrid, Spain; [Carvalho, William Douglas] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Invest Biodivers & Cambio Global CIBC UAM, Madrid, Spain; [Mejia, Paulo] Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Programa Pos Graduacao Biodiversidade Trop, Rod Juscelino Kubitscheck,km 2, BR-68903419 Macapa, AP, Brazil; [Carvalho, William Douglas] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Invest Biodivers & Cambio Global CIB UAM, Madrid, Spain",Fundacao Universidade Federal do Amapa; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid; Fundacao Universidade Federal do Amapa; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Mejia, P (corresponding author), Univ Fed Amapa UNIFAP, Programa Pos Graduacao Biodiversidade Trop, Rod Juscelino Kubitscheck,km 2, BR-68903419 Macapa, AP, Brazil.;Carvalho, WD (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Invest Biodivers & Cambio Global CIB UAM, Madrid, Spain.",paleopmz@gmail.com; william.mustin@uam.es,"Graciolli, Gustavo/B-5688-2013; VIANA, LUCIO/AAI-2614-2019; de Toledo, José/V-2465-2019; Urbieta, Gustavo/AAF-3930-2019; Carvalho, William Douglas/H-7894-2015","Carvalho, William Douglas/0000-0003-2518-9148; Lima Urbieta, Gustavo/0000-0002-1373-4498; VIANA, LUCIO/0000-0002-0932-0479","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Brazil; CAPES, Brazil; Ayudas Maria Zambrano - Spanish Ministry of Universities [88887.662021/2022-00]; Paraiba State Research Foundation (FAPESQ); PDPG-Amazpnia Legal [CA3/RSUE/2021-00197]; CNPq [518/18]; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul [88887.834037/2023-00]; Neotropical Grassland Conservancy [306216/2018, 316281/2021-22]; National Geographic Society; Bat Conservation International; Rufford Foundation","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CAPES, Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Ayudas Maria Zambrano - Spanish Ministry of Universities; Paraiba State Research Foundation (FAPESQ)(Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado da Paraiba (FAPESQPB)); PDPG-Amazpnia Legal; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Neotropical Grassland Conservancy; National Geographic Society(National Geographic Society); Bat Conservation International; Rufford Foundation","P.M. was supported by a master's scholarship and currently, is supported by doctoral scholarships from Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Brazil (process number 88887.662021/2022-00).

Identification of individual bats has relied on artificial marking techniques that may negatively affect the survival and alter the behavior of individuals. Biometric systems use biological characteristics to identify individuals. The field of animal biometrics has expanded to include recognition of individuals based upon various morphologies and phenotypic variations including pelage patterns, tail flukes, and whisker arrangement. Biometric systems use 4 biologic measurement criteria: universality, distinctiveness, permanence, and collectability. Additionally, the system should not violate assumptions of capture-recapture methods that include no increased mortality or alterations of behavior. We evaluated whether individual bats could be uniquely identified based upon the collagen-elastin bundles that are visible with gross examination of their wings. We examined little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), northern long-eared bats (M. septentrionalis), big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), and tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) to determine whether the wing prints from the bundle network would satisfy the biologic measurement criteria. We evaluated 1,212 photographs from 230 individual bats comparing week 0 photos with those taken at weeks 3 or 6 and were able to confirm identity of individuals over time. Two blinded evaluators were able to successfully match 170 individuals in hand to photographs taken at weeks 0, 3, and 6. This study suggests that bats can be successfully re-identified using photographs taken at previous times. We suggest further evaluation of this methodology for use in a standardized system that can be shared among bat conservationists.","[Amelon, Sybill K.] Univ Missouri, USDA, US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, 202 Anheuser Busch Nat Resources Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Hooper, Sarah E.] Univ Missouri, Coll Vet Med, 4011 Discovery Dr S219, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Womack, Kathryn M.] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, 202 Anheuser Busch Nat Resources Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Amelon, SK (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, USDA, US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, 202 Anheuser Busch Nat Resources Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",samelon@fs.fed.us,"Hooper, Sarah/KRP-5915-2024; amelon, s/GYQ-7127-2022","Hooper, Sarah/0000-0003-1150-2500; Amelon, Sybill/0000-0003-3940-8153",USDA Forest Service; Bat Conservation International (BCI); The Nature Conservancy (TNC); NIH [T32OD011126],USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Bat Conservation International (BCI); The Nature Conservancy (TNC); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"We thank M.

The first phenomenon would lead to character displacement, whereas the second can potentially promote morphological similarity through adaptive introgression. The main goal of this work was to investigate the effect of introgressive hybridization on the morphology of cryptic Iberian Eptesicus bats when facing counteracting evolutionary forces from interspecific competition. We found substantial overlap both in dentition and in wing morphology traits, though mainly in individuals in sympatry. The presence of hybrids contributes to a fifth of this overlap, with hybrids showing traits with intermediate morphometry. Thus, introgressive hybridization may contribute to species adaptation to trophic and ecological space responding directly to the macro-habitats characteristics of the sympatric zone and to local prey availability. On the other hand, fur shade tended to be browner and brighter in hybrids than parental species. Colour differences could result from partitioning of resources as an adaptation to environmental factors such as roost and microhabitats. We argue that a balance between adaptive introgression and niche partitioning shapes species interactions with the environment through affecting morphological traits under selection.","[Horta, Pedro; Raposeira, Helena; Rebelo, Hugo] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Horta, Pedro; Raposeira, Helena] Univ Porto, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias, P-4099002 Porto, Portugal; [Horta, Pedro; Raposeira, Helena] OII Observ Inovacao Invest, Seia, Portugal; [Banos, Adrian] Univ Pablo Olavide, Seville, Spain; [Ibanez, Carlos; Juste, Javier] Estac Biol Donana CSIC, Dept Ecol Evolut, Avda Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Ibanez, Carlos; Juste, Javier] CIBERESP, CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ, Madrid, Spain; [Razgour, Orly] Univ Exeter, Biosci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Rebelo, Hugo] Polytech Inst Setubal, ESS, Campus IPS Estefanilha, P-2910761 Setubal, Portugal; [Rebelo, Hugo] CIBIO, BIOPOLIS Program Genom, Biodivers & Land Planning, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Biologica de Donana (EBD); CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; University of Exeter; Instituto Politecnico de Setubal,"Horta, P (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.;Horta, P (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias, P-4099002 Porto, Portugal.;Horta, P (corresponding author), OII Observ Inovacao Invest, Seia, Portugal.",pedro.horta@cibio.up.pt,"Razgour, Orly/X-3478-2019; Ibanez, Carlos/H-7577-2015; Rebelo, Hugo/C-9005-2009; Juste, Javier/B-9253-2013; Razgour, Orly/B-9646-2011","Ibanez, Carlos/0000-0003-1181-7641; Rebelo, Hugo/0000-0002-7118-4068; Juste, Javier/0000-0003-1383-8462; Razgour, Orly/0000-0003-3186-0313; Raposeira, Helena/0000-0002-5552-7585; Sobreiro Horta, Pedro Miguel/0000-0003-0715-8559","Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [SFRH/BD/117979/2016, SFRH/BD/124367/2016]; FCT [DL57/2016/EEC2018/07]; Natural Environment Research Council Independent Research Fellowship [NE/M018660/1]; FEDER (European Regional Development Fund) through the Operational Competitiveness Factors Program - COMPETE; National Funds through FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/BIA-ECO/31731/2017- POCI-01-0145-FEDER-031731]; Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) [NORTE-01-0246-FEDER-000063]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/117979/2016, SFRH/BD/124367/2016] Funding Source: FCT; NERC [NE/M018660/2, NE/M018660/1, NE/M018660/3] Funding Source: UKRI","Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Natural Environment Research Council Independent Research Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); FEDER (European Regional Development Fund) through the Operational Competitiveness Factors Program - COMPETE(European Union (EU)); National Funds through FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","PH and HRap were funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) with a PhD grant (SFRH/BD/117979/2016 and SFRH/BD/124367/2016, respectively).

Based on the mitochondrial DNA D-loop region, we investigated the relationship between genetic structure and social characteristics in four species of phyllostomid bats (Sturnira hondurensis, Artibeus jamaicensis, Carollia sowelli, and Dermanura tolteca) inhabiting Selva El Ocote Biosphere Reserve (REBISO). According to their ecological characteristics, we expected a relatively high genetic diversity and stable populations, as well as a weak genetic structure in S. hondurensis and C. sowelli, and a moderate one in A. jamaicensis and D. tolteca. The demographic history and mismatch distribution were inferred. Besides, we estimated the time elapsed from demographic change (in munber of generations). Finally, we calculated standard genetic diversity indicators and determined the genetic structure, haplotype networks, and conducted spatial autocorrelation analyses. Genetic diversity was higher in S. hondurensis, intermediate in C. sowelli, and low in A. jamaicensis and D. tolteca. The neutrality tests indicated population expansion in A. jamaicensis, C. sowelli, and D. tolteca; S. hondurensis showed differentiation between populations with no apparent demographic changes. The extent of genetic differentiation was high in S. hondurensis, intermediate in C. sowelli, weak in A. jamaicensis, and nil in D. tolteca. The spatial autocorrelation revealed genetic structure at certain geographic distances in A. jamaicensis, C. sowelli, and S. hondurensis, while D. tolteca displayed a low structure at the greatest geographic distances. No clear relationship was evident between ecological attributes and genetic structure in the bat species studied, probably due to the slight differences in the ecological characteristics of these species. Further studies should include ecological factors such as resource availability and habitat selection, as well as nuclear markers, to obtain a biparental genetic estimation. This study highlights the need of conduct further research about the relationship of ecological and genetic traits of tropical bats in high-biodiversity reserves.","[Cruz-Salazar, Barbara; Garcia-Bautista, Maricela; Ruiz-Montoya, Lorena] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Consejo Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol, Carretera Fed Puebla Tlaxcala Km 1-5, Tlaxcala De Xicohtencatl 90062, Tlaxcala, Mexico",,"Cruz-Salazar, B (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Consejo Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol, Carretera Fed Puebla Tlaxcala Km 1-5, Tlaxcala De Xicohtencatl 90062, Tlaxcala, Mexico.",bcruz@ecosur.edu.mx,"Cruz-Salazar, Bárbara/JBS-1539-2023",,CONACYT [PDCPN-2013/214650],CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"The authors wish to thank the communities living in Selva El Ocote Biosphere Reserve and the Comision Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas for their assistance in the development of this work.

Males of many mammal species tend to be larger or more ornamented than females, and these characteristics tend to be more pronounced in polygynous, diurnal, and open-habitat species. Bats have long been considered a largely non-sexually dimorphic group due to lack of conspicuous differences in body size and other cranial and skeletal characters. However, bats, like many mammals, exhibit a diverse array of soft-tissue integumentary glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures with intense odorous substances that have not been thoroughly investigated, although postulated functions include facilitating mate selection in their generally polygynous associations. To date, there has been no systematic assessment of the occurrence or expression of sexually dimorphic traits in bats, many of which show intriguing sexual dimorphism in soft tissue, and most of which involve intense odours. In this study, we review evidence of integumentary glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures known in bats, as a first step towards identifying future research pathways to study sexual dimorphism in bats. Highly variable glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures have been noticed in ten different regions of the body, but are most frequently found on the head and the ventral region of the neck. They have been described in nearly 9% of bat species and in 70% of 21 extant bat families. Our review, based on extremely scattered and unevenly detailed literature, unveils the extraordinary sexual dimorphism that has been observed in Chiroptera to date, identifying not only target body parts where sexually dimorphic traits are likely to be found, but also critical avenues for future investigation and discoveries, and stressing the importance of the timing of secondary sexual trait observations, behavioural studies, and chemical analyses.","[Munoz-Romo, Mariana; Page, Rachel A.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; [Munoz-Romo, Mariana] Univ Andes, Lab Zool Aplicada, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias, Merida 5101, Venezuela; [Kunz, Thomas H.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Conservat Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; University of Los Andes Venezuela; Boston University,"Muñoz-Romo, M (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Balboa, Ancon, Panama.;Muñoz-Romo, M (corresponding author), Univ Andes, Lab Zool Aplicada, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias, Merida 5101, Venezuela.",munozml@si.edu; pager@si.edu,"Muñoz-Romo, Mariana/AEN-8478-2022; Page, Rachel/GQQ-2818-2022","Page, Rachel/0000-0001-7072-0669; Munoz-Romo, Mariana/0000-0002-6595-7386",,,,,142,9,11,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,APR,2021,51,2,,,,,155,177,,10.1111/mam.12232,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.12232,,JAN 2021,23,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,QW5EX,,Bronze,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000612742300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In many temperate-forest environments, bats represent a large portion of the vertebrate species diversity, but for most locations we lack basic data regarding habitat needs. We describe characteristics of diurnal roost trees and stands used by radio-tagged bats in the sub-boreal forest of central British Columbia. We tracked 12 female Myotis lucifugus, 2 M. volans, and 1 M. septentrionalis to 33-day-roosts and found 4 additional roosts by random observations and inspecting cavities for guano. The 37 roosts occurred primarily in two species of trees, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta; n = 18) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides; n = 17). In lodgepole pine, trees were in early stages of decay and bats roosted under bark, usually alone. Trembling aspen more typically contained groups of roosting bats (henceforth communal roosts; n = 14 trees). Communal roosts were all in vertical cracks that were formed from a combination of trauma causing a wood scar and decay fungi. Other species of trees used as roosts included black cottonwood (P. balsamifera; n = 1) and hybrid white spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii; n = 1). We constructed logistic regression models for conifer and deciduous roosts used by M. lucifugus and M. volans to determine selection characteristics. Results from our analyses suggest that in sub-boreal forests, management of bat habitat should focus on the maintenance of: (1) mature stands; (2) individual lodgepole pine trees with exfoliating bark, few missing limbs, and free of potential obstructions to roost entrance; (3) large diameter trembling aspen, with long vertical cracks, in stands with fewer stems per hectare. No roosts were located in cavities excavated by woodpeckers, which implies that in our study area management plans that incorporate bats as secondary cavity users may not be sufficient to maintain populations.

(1999) present an updated qualitative method for identifying species from their echolocation calls. However, they make the assumption that, like bird songs, echolocation calls of bats are species-specific. There is no reason to expect that natural selection favored incorporation of this information. Although identification of some species of bats by their calls is possible, variation at several levels makes other species indistinguishable. Monitoring echolocation in the field and identifying species can be useful in determining presence or absence of species and factors influencing activity of bats. However limitations and degree of reliability of the technique must be recognized. Only by more explicitly defining how the method is used and quantifying characteristics that define calls of recognizable species will the method be;scientifically sound and repeatable.

Bats comprise one of the most diverse groups of mammals in urban areas, and many species are threatened by habitat destruction and land use change. Yet, in Africa, the response of bats to urban areas is relatively understudied. Therefore, we collated data on urban presence, phylogenetic relationship, and ecological traits of 54 insectivorous bats in Africa from available literature to test if their response to urbanization was phylogenetically and/or ecologically driven. Ancestral state reconstruction of urban tolerance, defined by functional group and presence observed in urban areas, suggests that ancestral African bat species could adapt to urban landscapes, and significant phylogenetic signal for urban tolerance indicates that this ability is evolutionarily conserved and mediated by pre-adaptations. Specifically, traits of high wing loading and aspect ratio, and flexible roosting strategies, enable occupancy of urban areas. Therefore, our results identify the traits that predict which bat species will likely occur in urban areas, and which vulnerable bat clades conservation efforts should focus on to reduce loss of both functional and phylogenetic diversity in Africa. We, additionally, highlight several gaps in research that should be investigated in future studies to provide better monitoring of the impact urbanization will have on African bats.","[Marsden, Genevieve E.; Vosloo, Dalene] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Ctr Funct Biodivers, Sch Life Sci, Private Bag X54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Schoeman, M.

Delicate maxilloturbinal bones inside the nasal fossa of horseshoe bats have a unique elongated strand-like shape unknown in other mammals. Maxilloturbinal strands also vary considerably in length and cross-sectional shape. In other mammals, maxilloturbinals help direct respired air and prevent respiratory heat and water loss. We investigated whether strand-shaped maxilloturbinals in horseshoe bats perform a similar function to those of other mammals, or whether they were shaped for a role in nasophonation. Using histology, we studied the mucosa of the nasal fossa in Rhinolophus lepidus, which we compared with Hipposideros lankadiva (Hipposideridae) and Megaderma lyra (Megadermatidae). Using micro-CT scans of 30 horseshoe bat species, we quantified maxilloturbinal surface area and skull shape within a phylogenetic context. Histological results showed horseshoe bat maxilloturbinals are covered in a thin, poorly vascularized, sparsely ciliated mucosa poorly suited for preventing respiratory heat and water loss. Maxilloturbinal surface area was correlated with basicranial width, but exceptionally long and dorsoventrally flat maxilloturbinals did not show enhanced surface area for heat and moisture exchange. Skull shape variation appears to be driven by structures linked to nasophonation, including maxilloturbinals. Resting echolocation call frequency better predicted skull shape than did skull size, and was specifically correlated with dimensions of the rostral inflations, palate, and maxilloturbinals. These traits appear to form a morphological complex, indicating a nasophonatory role for the strand-shaped rhinolophid maxilloturbinals. Anat Rec, 2018.

Fifty-three percent of the trees were living; 52% of the roosts were in crevices or hollows, and the rest were under exfoliating bark. Northern bats did not use American elms (Ulmus americana) in proportion to their abundance, but in general, characteristics of roost trees were similar to a random sample of apparently suitable trees. Northern bats changed roosts every 2 days, and distance between roosts varied from 6 to 2,000 m. As many as 60 adults were found in a single tree, making this the largest summer aggregation ever reported for the species.

The shrew, Crocidura shantungensis, which is an indigenous species of Ulleung-do, is dominant on this island and is suspected to have unique traits different from other shrews. Based on a previous sperm ultrastructural analysis, the structural and morphometric traits of caudal epididymal spermatozoa were evaluated by light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Total length was 110.0 mu m. The head was paddle shaped with a globular nucleus and was 16.0 mu m in length. The acrosomal cap covered four-fifths of the nucleus, and the subacrosomal space had sawtooth-shaped edges. The number of mitochondrial gyres was 84-86. Nine segmented columns in the neck consisted of 12 knobs, and each column was fused with outer dense fiber. The outer dense fibers 1, 5, and 6 were thicker than the others. Outer fiber 1 was shaped like a horseshoe, whereas 5 and 6 were fused with each other. Numerous satellite fibers were scattered on the mid-piece between outer fibers 4 and 5, and 6 and 7. Two specific strong electron-dense fibers were found uniquely near the satellite fibers. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the caudal sperm of Ulleung-do C. shantungensis has unique ultrastructural and morphometric traits based on common sperm characters of the subfamilies, suggesting unique physiological roles in reproduction.","[Cheon, Yong-Pil] Sungshin Womens Univ, Sch Biosci & Chem, Div Dev & Physiol, Coll Nat Sci, Seoul 142742, South Korea; [Lee, Sung-Ho] Sangmyung Univ, Dept Life Sci, Seoul 110743, South Korea; [Lee, Jung-Hun] Kyungnam Univ, Dept Sci Educ, Changwon Si 631701, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea",Sungshin Women's University; Sangmyung University; Kyungnam University,"Lee, JH (corresponding author), Kyungnam Univ, Dept Sci Educ, 449 Woryeong Dong, Changwon Si 631701, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea.",jhlee@kyungnam.ac.kr,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0720-213X,1432-234X,,ZOOMORPHOLOGY,Zoomorphology,JUN,2015,134,2,,,,,317,324,,10.1007/s00435-014-0249-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00435-014-0249-0,,,8,Anatomy & Morphology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Anatomy & Morphology; Zoology,CI0DH,,,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000354405600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is especially true in long-lived, group-living species that encounter moderate levels of environmental heterogeneity. Here we review the social learning literature that uses bats as models under the framework of Galef (2009) and Laland (2009) to examine when, where, and from whom bats are most likely to learn socially about food and other foraging behaviour. We conclude that evidence exists for bats learning about novel foods from other bats, learning how to handle such food from other bats, and that bats often learn these ways when uncertain about the quality of different foods available. There is also evidence that young bats learn about new foods from their mothers, and that adult bats learn from other adult bats, even other bat species. However, whether bats more likely to learn from familiar individuals or learn about specific foraging areas from others is less established and warrants further research. We also conclude that phyllostomid bats present the best evidence of social learning about food and suggest future research, including investigating the possibility of nonhuman culture, focus on this diverse group.","[Patriquin, Krista J.] Sable Isl Inst, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Patriquin, Krista J.] St Marys Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Ratcliffe, John M.] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Patriquin, KJ (corresponding author), Sable Isl Inst, Halifax, NS, Canada.;Patriquin, KJ (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS, Canada.;Ratcliffe, JM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON, Canada.",krista.patriquin@smu.ca; j.ratcliffe@utoronto.ca,"Patriquin, Krista/AAR-7981-2020",,NSERC,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We thank Mark Brigham and Brian Gordon for expert handling of our manuscript and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on our original submission.

However, many studies have only explored diversification mechanisms via isolated factors. Here, based on comparative phylogenetic analysis, we performed a macroevolutionary examination of horseshoe bats (Chiroptera: Rhinolophidae: Rhinolophus), to reveal the inter-relationships among diversification, intrinsic/extrinsic factors, and climatic ecological niche characteristics. Results showed a general slowing trajectory during diversification, with two dispersal events from Asia into Southeast Asia and Africa playing key roles in shaping regional heterogeneous diversity. Morphospace expansions of the investigated traits (e.g., body size, echolocation, and climate niche) revealed a decoupled pattern between diversification trajectory and trait divergence, suggesting that other factors (e.g., biotic interactions) potentially played a key role in recent diversification. Based on ancestral traits and pathway analyses, most Rhinolophus lineages belonging to the same region overlapped with each other geographically and were positively associated with the diversification rate, implying a competitive prelude to speciation. Overall, our study showed that multiple approaches need to be integrated to address diversification history. Rather than a single factor, the joint effects of multiple factors (biogeography, environmental drivers, and competition) are responsible for the current diversity patterns in horseshoe bats, and a corresponding multifaceted strategy is recommended to study these patterns in the future.","[Guo, Wei-Jian; Wu, Yi; He, Kai; Wang, Xiao-Yun; Yu, Wen-Hua] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Conservat & Applicat Biodivers South China, Guangzhou 510000, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yi-Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, CAS Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Guangzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Zoology, CAS","Wang, XY; Yu, WH (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Conservat & Applicat Biodivers South China, Guangzhou 510000, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wangxy0607@163.com; wenhua_yu@gzhu.edu.cn,"YU, Wenhua/ABI-2704-2020","Guo, Weijian/0009-0007-5746-9888","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31970394, 32192421, 31300314]; Special Foundation for National Science and Technology Basic Research Program of China [2021FY100303]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Foundation for National Science and Technology Basic Research Program of China,"Foundation items: This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31970394, 32192421, 31300314) and Special Foundation for National Science and Technology Basic Research Program of China (2021FY100303)",,78,4,4,7,30,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-8137,,,ZOOL RES,Zool.

Some unique bat characteristics can explain the roles played in the maintenance and transmission of viruses: long phylogenetic history can have originated coevolution processes, great number of species are adapted to live in different environments, big mobility, long lifespan and gregarious behaviour of many species. To analyse zoonoses long longitudinal studies are needed with a multi-disciplinary approximation to obtain the following eco-epidemiological data: colony size, number of bats per species, population structure, behaviour of each species, degree of contact between bats, social structure, remaining time of bats in the colony, colony type, foraging area, turnover rate of individuals, shelter temperature, relationship with other colonies and co-infection processes. These data allows assessing the epidemiological risk and which preventive measures are necessary to take. The structure and functionality of ecosystems are changing worldwide at an unprecedented rate and can modify the interactions between humans and infected bats. There are more or less local factors that can affect the emergence and spread of diseases (environmental alterations, changes in land use, human population growth, changes in human socioeconomic behavior or social structure, people mobility increase, trade increase, forest fires, extreme weather events, wars, breakdown in public health infrastructure, etc.). Twenty-three percent of all bat species in the world are decreasing. How does the regression of bat species affect the dynamic of viruses?

To benefit crevice/cavity roosting bat species, forests are often enhanced with the use of tree girdling. In October 2015, 20 maples, 22 oaks, and 18 hickories were girdled using a method with fell cut and herbicide (frilling) or double-girdling with a chainsaw. From 2016-2021, targeted trees were observed and the tree's decay state was collected. The average time for trees to display suitable roosting characteristics for frilling trees was 3.23 years while it was 4.46 years for double girdling. The average time frilling trees contained suitable roosting characteristics was 3.20 years while it was 1.63 years for double girdling. The frilling method resulted in a quicker kill of trees than double girdling and frilling trees had suitable roosting characteristics for a longer duration. Frilling was effective killing all three types of trees, while the double girdling was less effective, especially on oaks. When grouping species and treatment in analysis, only average decay states between maple frill and oak double girdling and hickory frill and oak double girdling were significantly different. This evaluation demonstrates that roost tree creation relating to tree species and girdling methodology has a temporal component that should be considered when managing for crevice/cavity bat roosts and multiple habitat creation methods should be used in conjunction with snag creation to provide sustainable bat habitat over longer time periods.","[Schroder, Eric S.; Ward, Ryan L.] AllStar Ecol LLC, 1582 Meadowdale Rd, Fairmont, WV 26554 USA",,"Ward, RL (corresponding author), AllStar Ecol LLC, 1582 Meadowdale Rd, Fairmont, WV 26554 USA.",eric.schroder@allstarecology.com; ryan@allstarecology.com,,,,,,,48,2,5,0,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,FEB,2022,13,2,,,,,,,274,10.3390/f13020274,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13020274,,,9,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,ZO1ZV,,gold,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000765531500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While extensively studied in songbirds, mammalian models for vocal learning are rare. Bats present a promising study system given their gregarious natures, small size, and the ability of some species to be maintained in captive colonies. We utilize the pale spear-nosed bat (Phyllostomus discolor) and report advances in establishing this species as a tractable model for understanding vocal learning. We have taken an interdisciplinary approach, aiming to provide an integrated understanding across genomics (Part I), neurobiology (Part II), and transgenics (Part III). In Part I, we generated new, high-quality genome annotations of coding genes and noncoding microRNAs to facilitate functional and evolutionary studies. In Part II, we traced connections between auditory-related brain regions and reported neuroimaging to explore the structure of the brain and gene expression patterns to highlight brain regions. In Part III, we created the first successful transgenic bats by manipulating the expression of FoxP2, a speech-related gene. These interdisciplinary approaches are facilitating a mechanistic and evolutionary understanding of mammalian vocal learning and can also contribute to other areas of investigation that utilize P. discolor or bats as study species.","[Vernes, Sonja C.; Devanna, Paolo; Hoerpel, Stephen Gareth; van Tussenbroek, Ine Alvarez] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Bute Bldg,Queens Terrace, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland; [Vernes, Sonja C.; Devanna, Paolo; Hoerpel, Stephen Gareth; van Tussenbroek, Ine Alvarez; Hoeksema, Nienke; Lavrichenko, Ksenia; Mengede, Janine] Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Neurogenet Vocal Commun Grp, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Hoerpel, Stephen Gareth; Firzlaff, Uwe] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Hagoort, Peter; Hoeksema, Nienke] Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Neurobiol Language Dept, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Hiller, Michael; Morales, Ariadna E.] Goethe Univ, Senckenberg Res Inst, Fac Biosci, LOEWE Ctr Translat Biodivers Genom, Frankfurt, Germany; [Hughes, Graham M.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Belfield, Ireland; [Wiesmann, Maximilian] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Preclin Imaging Ctr PRIME,Med Ctr, Ctr Med Neurosci,Dept Med Imaging Anat,Radboud Al, Nijmegen, Netherlands",University of St Andrews; Max Planck Society; Technical University of Munich; Max Planck Society; Leibniz Association; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Goethe University Frankfurt; University College Dublin; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Vernes, SC (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Bute Bldg,Queens Terrace, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland.",scv1@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Wiesmann, Maximilian/AAW-1627-2021; Hagoort, Peter/B-7417-2012; Morales, Ariadna/KHD-8975-2024; Vernes, Sonja/E-8454-2012; Wiesmann, Maximilian/C-5482-2012","Firzlaff, Uwe/0000-0003-2803-3587; Vernes, Sonja/0000-0003-0305-4584; Morales, Ariadna E/0000-0002-0637-7349; Wiesmann, Maximilian/0000-0002-1412-398X",UK Research and Innovation [MR/T021985/1]; Max-Planck-Gesellschaft; Human Frontier Science Program [RGP0058/2016]; UKRI FLF [MR/T021985/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Research and Innovation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); Max-Planck-Gesellschaft(Max Planck Society); Human Frontier Science Program(Human Frontier Science Program); UKRI FLF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"UK Research and Innovation, Grant/Award Number: MR/T021985/1; Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Grant/Award Number: Max Planck Research Group; Human Frontier Science Program, Grant/Award Number: RGP0058/2016",,114,5,5,2,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0077-8923,1749-6632,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.

Accordingly, the cranial structure in bats is unusually variable among mammals and thought to reflect specializations for feeding and echolocation. However, recent analyses of cranial structure, feeding behavior and bite force across a wide range of bats suggest that correlations between morphology and performance and/or ecology are not as clearcut as previously thought. For example, most of the variation in bite force across a wide range of phyllostomid bats was explained by differences in body size rather than specific cranial traits. However, remarkably little is known about the muscular components that are responsible for generating the actual bite forces. We have tested which aspects of the cranial muscular system are good predictors of bite force across a wide range of species using a modeling approach. Model calculations of bite force show good correspondence with in vivo data suggesting that they can be used to estimate performance of the cranial system. Moreover, our data show that bite force is strikingly well explained by differences in temporalis muscle mass, temporalis fiber length and masseter muscle mass. Moreover, our data show that evolutionary changes in bite force capacity in bats are associated with evolutionary changes in relative m. temporalis mass and absolute skull length.","[Herrel, Anthony; De Smet, Ann; Aerts, Peter] Univ Antwerp VIB, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Aguirre, Luis F.] Univ Mayor San Simon, Ctr Biodiversidad & Genet, Cochabamba, Bolivia",Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB); University of Antwerp; Universidad Mayor de San Simon,"Herrel, A (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp VIB, Dept Biol, Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",anthony.herrel@ua.ac.be,"Aguirre, Luis/AAE-9255-2019; Herrel, Anthony/C-3712-2013","Herrel, Anthony/0000-0003-0991-4434; Aguirre, Luis/0000-0002-4194-1523; Aerts, Peter/0000-0002-6867-5421",,,,,41,133,152,3,26,COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND",0022-0949,,,J EXP BIOL,J.

A strong association between bat skull morphology and feeding behavior has been suggested previously. However, morphological variation related to other drivers of adaptation, in particular echolocation, remains understudied. We assessed variation in skull morphology with respect to ecology (diet and emission type) and function (bite force, masticatory muscles and echolocation characteristics) using geometric morphometrics and comparative methods. Our study suggests that variation in skull shape of 10 bat families is the result of adaptations to broad dietary categories and sound emission types (oral or nasal). Skull shape correlates with echolocation parameters only in a subsample of insectivorous species, possibly because they (almost) entirely rely on this sensory system for locating and capturing prey. Insectivores emitting low frequencies are characterized by a ventrally tilted rostrum, a trait not associated with feeding parameters. This result questions the validity of a trade-off between feeding and echolocation function. Our study advances understanding of the relationship between skull morphology and specific features of echolocation and suggests that evolutionary constraints due to echolocation may differ between different groups within the Chiroptera.","[Giacomini, Giada; Brown, Richard P.; Meloro, Carlo] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Res Ctr Evolutionary Anthropol & Palaeoecol, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Byrom St, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Herrel, Anthony] CNRS MNHN, Dept Ecol & Gest Paris, Paris, France; [Chaverri, Gloriana] Univ Costa Rica, Recinto Golfito, Golfito, Costa Rica; [Chaverri, Gloriana] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; [Russo, Danilo] Univ Napoli Federico II, Wildlife Res Unit, Dipartimento Agr, Portici, Italy; [Russo, Danilo] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg, Bristol, Avon, England; [Scaravelli, Dino] Univ Bologna, Dept Vet Med Sci, Ozzano Dell Emilia, Italy",Liverpool John Moores University; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Universidad Costa Rica; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; University of Naples Federico II; University of Bristol; University of Bologna,"Meloro, C (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Res Ctr Evolutionary Anthropol & Palaeoecol, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Byrom St, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",C.Meloro@ljmu.ac.uk,"Meloro, Carlo/U-4527-2019; Chaverri, Gloriana/J-4798-2012; Herrel, Anthony/C-3712-2013",,"SYNTHESYS 3 Project - European Community Research Infrastructure Action under the FP7 [BE-TAF-6601, HU-TAF-6926, DK-TAF-6870, FR-TAF-6924, AT-TAF-6820]",SYNTHESYS 3 Project - European Community Research Infrastructure Action under the FP7,"The authors are grateful to the staff of the following museums for providing access and allowing collection of morphological data: Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Science (Brussels), Magyar Termeszettudomanyi Muzeum (Budapest), Statens Naturhistoriske Museum (Copenhagen), World Museum (Liverpool), London Natural History Museum, Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (Paris) and Naturhistorisches Museum (Vienna).

From I June to 31 August (2004-2005), we used Anabat II detectors to examine bat activity and species occupancy relative to forested corridors on an intensively managed forest landscape in southern South Carolina, USA. We compared bat activity among corridor interiors, corridor edges, and stands adjacent to corridors. We also compared models relating occupancy of bat species to site-level characteristics using an information theoretic approach. We identified 16,235 call sequences of 8 species and detected bat presence at 89% (n = 320) of sites sampled. Our results indicate higher occupancy rates for bats along corridor edges compared to interior corridor or adjacent stands. Although we found few differences among species with respect to site-level characteristics, occupancy of all bat species was positively associated with corridor overstory height and negatively associated with adjacent stand age. The presence of roads adjacent to corridors positively influenced occupancy of Eptesicus fuscus, Lasiurus seminolus, and Perlmyotis subflavus. Our results suggest management practices designed to create and enhance corridors may represent an ecologically sound method for maintaining important bat habitat features (i.e., edge) across managed forest landscapes.

Research on bats and wetlands has mainly focused on constructed wetlands, and with a geographical emphasis on eastern United States and central Europe, whereas relatively little is known about the effects of wetland restoration on bats, especially in the boreal zone. We conducted a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study in 21 wetlands. Using acoustic survey techniques, we collected information on bats both before and after restoration, with 7 of the 21 wetlands acting as control sites and 14 as impact (i.e., restored) sites. Acoustic surveys were conducted in May-September in the years 2018, 2019 (before restoration) and in 2021 and 2022 (after restoration). Species detection for each night was assessed by automated analysis of audio recordings. We assessed the presence and number of active minutes of the Northern bat (Eptesicus nilssonii) and the Myotis species group, using a generalized linear mixed model. Wetland restoration increased the acoustic activity of both taxa, but not their presence. Thus, restoration increased the usage of wetlands as a feeding site for bats. Our BACI study provides strong evidence that wetland restoration caused an increase in bat activity, and can be used as an effective tool for bat conservation.","[Vasko, Ville; Gaultier, Simon P.; Blomberg, Anna; Norrdahl, Kai; Brommer, Jon E.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20500, Finland; [Vasko, Ville] Turku Univ Appl Sci, Engn & Business, Chem Ind, Turku 20520, Finland; [Blomberg, Anna; Lilley, Thomas M.] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Helsinki 00100, Finland",University of Turku; Turku University of Applied Sciences; University of Helsinki,"Gaultier, SP (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20500, Finland.",simon.s.gaultier@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013; Lilley, Thomas/F-2236-2015; Brommer, Jon/C-3613-2008","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Lilley, Thomas/0000-0001-5864-4958; Blomberg, Anna/0000-0002-6754-4948; Brommer, Jon/0000-0002-2435-2612",LIFE Programme [LIFE16/NAT/FI/000583]; LIFE Programme of the European Union (Hydrology LIFE); European Commission,LIFE Programme; LIFE Programme of the European Union (Hydrology LIFE); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The project has received funding from the LIFE Programme of the European Union (Hydrology LIFE; LIFE16/NAT/FI/000583).

However, it is unclear if this allometry applies to the entire clade. Differences have been suggested between nasal and oral emitting bats, as well as between some taxonomic families. Additionally, the scaling of other echolocation parameters, such as bandwidth and call duration, needs further testing. Moreover, it would be also interesting to test whether changes in body size have been coupled with changes in these echolocation parameters throughout bat evolution. Here, we test the scaling of peak frequency, bandwidth, and call duration with body mass using phylogenetically informed analyses for 314 bat species. We specifically tested whether all these scaling patterns differ between nasal and oral emitting bats. Then, we applied recently developed Bayesian statistical techniques based on large-scale simulations to test for the existence of correlated evolution between body mass and echolocation.Results Our results showed that echolocation peak frequencies, bandwidth, and duration follow significant allometric patterns in both nasal and oral emitting bats. Changes in these traits seem to have been coupled across the laryngeal echolocation bats diversification. Scaling and correlated evolution analyses revealed that body mass is more related to peak frequency and call duration than to bandwidth. We exposed two non-exclusive kinds of mechanisms to explain the link between size and each of the echolocation parameters.Conclusions The incorporation of Bayesian statistics based on large-scale simulations could be helpful for answering macroevolutionary patterns related to the coevolution of traits in bats and other taxonomic groups.","[Castro, Mario G.; Amado, Talita Ferreira; Olalla-Tarraga, Miguel a.] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Calle Tulipan S-N, Madrid 28933, Spain; [Castro, Mario G.; Olalla-Tarraga, Miguel a.] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Inst Cambio Global, Madrid 28933, Spain; [Amado, Talita Ferreira] German Ctr Integrat Bioaffiliationers Res iDiv, Puschstr 4, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Castro, MG (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Calle Tulipan S-N, Madrid 28933, Spain.;Castro, MG (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Inst Cambio Global, Madrid 28933, Spain.",mario.gcastro@urjc.es,"Amado, Talita/Y-5710-2019","Gil Castro, Mario/0000-0003-3682-9446",,,,,80,1,1,9,21,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2730-7182,,BMC ECOL EVOL,BMC Ecol.

While in the Japanese lesser horseshoe bat, the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium was divided into 10 stages and developing spermatids were subdivided into 13 steps. Excepting slight morphological differences, the characteristics of acrosomal formation in both species were almost similar with each other. In the Java fruit bat after stage VII, the acrosome gradually elongated, flattened and finally became scoop-like in shape.

How individual tropical tree species respond to climate change remains relatively unknown. In this study, we refined the species characterization in the CARAIB (CARbon Assimilation In the Biosphere) dynamic vegetation model by replacing plant functional type morpho-physiological traits by species-specific traits. We focus on 12 tropical tree species selected for their importance in both the plant community and human society. We used CARAIB to simulate the current species net primary productivity (NPP), biomass and potential distribution and their changes in the future. Our results indicate that the use of species-specific traits does not necessarily result in an increase of predicted current NPPs. The model projections for the end of the century highlight the large uncertainties in the future of African tropical species. Projected changes in species distribution vary greatly with the general circulation model (GCM) and, to a lesser extent, with the concentration pathway. The question about long-term plant response to increasing CO2 concentrations also leads to contrasting results. In absence of fertilization effect, species are exposed to climate change and might lose 25% of their current distribution under RCP8.5 (12.5% under RCP4.5), considering all the species and climatic scenarios. The vegetation model projects a mean biomass loss of -21.2% under RCP4.5 and -34.5% under RCP8.5. Potential range expansions, unpredictable due to migration limitations, are too limited for offsetting range contraction. By contrast, if the long-term species response to increasing [CO2] is positive, the range reduction is limited to 5%. However, despite a mean biomass increase of 12.2%, a positive CO2 feedback might not prevent tree dieback. Our analysis confirms that species will respond differently to new climatic and atmospheric conditions, which may induce new competition dynamics in the ecosystem and affect ecosystem services.","[Dury, Marie; Mertens, Lenni; Francois, Louis] Univ Liege, UR SPHERES, Modelisat Climat & Cycles Biogeochim, Quartier Agora, Bat B5c,Allee Six Aout 19c, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Mertens, Lenni; Hambuckers, Alain] Univ Liege, UR SPHERES, Biol Comportement, Quai Van Beneden 22, B-4020 Liege, Belgium; [Fayolle, Adeline] Univ Liege, TERRA Teaching & Res Ctr, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Gest Ressources Forestieres, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Verbeeck, Hans] Univ Ghent, Computat & Appl Vegetat Ecol CAVElab, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",University of Liege; University of Liege; University of Liege; Ghent University,"Dury, M (corresponding author), Univ Liege, UR SPHERES, Modelisat Climat & Cycles Biogeochim, Quartier Agora, Bat B5c,Allee Six Aout 19c, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",Marie.Dury@uliege.be; lennimertens@gmail.com; adeline.fayolle@uliege.be; hans.verbeeck@ugent.be; Alain.Hambuckers@uliege.be; Louis.Francois@uliege.be,"Verbeeck, Hans/A-2106-2009; François, Louis/K-9172-2019; Hambuckers, Alain/H-9911-2014","Francois, Louis/0000-0001-8292-8360; Hambuckers, Alain/0000-0003-2594-2064; Verbeeck, Hans/0000-0003-1490-0168; FAYOLLE, Adeline/0000-0002-6770-0031",BIOSERF project within the SSD; AFRIFORD project within the SSD; BRAIN-be programs of Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO),BIOSERF project within the SSD; AFRIFORD project within the SSD; BRAIN-be programs of Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO),Funding for this research by the BIOSERF and the AFRIFORD projects within the SSD and BRAIN-be programs of Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO) is gratefully acknowledged.,,118,13,13,1,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,NOV,2018,9,11,,,,,,,722,10.3390/f9110722,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f9110722,,,26,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,HB8BX,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2025-02-11,WOS:000451310300062,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet how traits should assemble to boost multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously (multifunctionality) remains poorly explored. In a multibiome litter experiment covering most of the global variation in leaf trait spectra, we showed that three dimensions of functional diversity (dispersion, rarity, and evenness) explained up to 66% of variations in multifunctionality, although the dominant species and their traits remained an important predictor. While high dispersion impeded multifunctionality, increasing the evenness among functionally dissimilar species was a key dimension to promote higher multifunctionality and to reduce the abundance of plant pathogens. Because too-dissimilar species could have negative effects on ecosystems, our results highlight the need for not only diverse but also functionally even assemblages to promote multifunctionality. The effect of functionally rare species strongly shifted from positive to negative depending on their trait differences with the dominant species. Simultaneously managing the dispersion, evenness, and rarity in multispecies assemblages could be used to design assemblages aimed at maximizing multifunctionality independently of the biome, the identity of dominant species, or the range of trait values considered. Functional evenness and rarity offer promise to improve the management of terrestrial ecosystems and to limit plant disease risks.","[Le Bagousse-Pinguet, Yoann] Aix Marseille Univ, Avignon Univ, Inst Rech Dev IRD,CNRS, Inst Mediterraneen Biodiversite & Ecol Marine & C, Technopole Arbois Mediterranee Bat Villemin,BP 80, F-13545 Aix En Provence 04, France; [Le Bagousse-Pinguet, Yoann; Gross, Nicolas; Saiz, Hugo; Ruiz, Sonia; Dacal, Marina; Milla, Ruben; Garcia-Palacios, Pablo] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan & Analit, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Mostoles 28933, Spain; [Gross, Nicolas] Univ Clermont Auvergne, Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm INRAE, VetAgro Sup, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Saiz, Hugo] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Maestre, Fernando T.] Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol, Carretera San Vicente Raspeig S-N, Alicante 03690, Spain; [Maestre, Fernando T.; Dacal, Marina; Asensio, Sergio; Ochoa, Victoria; Gozalo, Beatriz] Univ Alicante, Inst Multidisciplinar Estudio Medio Ramon Margale, Carretera San Vicente Raspeig S-N, Alicante 03690, Spain; [Cornelissen, Johannes H.

A small but ecologically and economically important group of plants classified in 28 orders, 67 families and about 528 species of angiosperms are pollinated by nectar-feeding bats. From a phylogenetic perspective this is a derived pollination mode involving a relatively large and energetically expensive pollinator. Here its ecological and evolutionary consequences are explored. Scope and Conclusions This review summarizes adaptations in bats and plants that facilitate this interaction and discusses the evolution of bat pollination from a plant phylogenetic perspective. Two families of bats contain specialized flower visitors, one in the Old World and one in the New World. Adaptation to pollination by bats has evolved independently many times from a variety of ancestral conditions, including insect-, bird- and non-volant mammal-pollination. Bat pollination predominates in very few families but is relatively common in certain angiosperm subfamilies and tribes. We propose that flower-visiting bats provide two important benefits to plants: they deposit large amounts of pollen and a variety of pollen genotypes on plant stigmas and, compared with many other pollinators, they are long-distance pollen dispersers. Bat pollination tends to occur in plants that occur in low densities and in lineages producing large flowers. In highly fragmented tropical habitats, nectar bats play an important role in maintaining the genetic continuity of plant populations and thus have considerable conservation value.","[Fleming, Theodore H.] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Geiselman, Cullen] New York Bot Garden, Inst Systemat Bot, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Kress, W.

These include CoVs that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and severe acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS). Bats that are naturally infected or experimentally infected do not demonstrate clinical signs of disease. These observations have allowed researchers to speculate that bats are the likely reservoirs or ancestral hosts for several CoVs. In this review, we follow the CoV outbreaks that are speculated to have originated in bats. We review studies that have allowed researchers to identify unique adaptation in bats that may allow them to harbor CoVs without severe disease. We speculate about future studies that are critical to identify how bats can harbor multiple strains of CoVs and factors that enable these viruses to jump from bats to other mammals. We hope that this review will enable readers to identify gaps in knowledge that currently exist and initiate a dialogue amongst bat researchers to share resources to overcome present limitations.","[Banerjee, Arinjay; Mossman, Karen] McMaster Univ, Michael DeGroote Inst Infect Dis Res, Dept Pathol & Mol Med, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Kulcsar, Kirsten; Frieman, Matthew] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Misra, Vikram] Univ Saskatchewan, Western Coll Vet Med, Dept Vet Microbiol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B4, Canada",McMaster University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University of Saskatchewan,"Mossman, K (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Michael DeGroote Inst Infect Dis Res, Dept Pathol & Mol Med, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",banera9@mcmaster.ca; KKulcsar@som.umaryland.edu; vikram.misra@usask.ca; MFrieman@som.umaryland.edu; mossk@mcmaster.ca,"Banerjee, Arinjay/AHD-1205-2022; Misra, Vikram/AAC-4266-2020","Frieman, Matthew/0000-0003-0107-0775; Kulcsar, Kirsten/0000-0001-9385-8775; Banerjee, Arinjay/0000-0002-2821-8357",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada's Discovery Grants; M.G.

Bat echolocation activity surveys are the standard method for assessing risk, but their effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Sites with relatively low pre-construction bat activity rates are predicted to yield relatively low post-construction fatality-rates (i.e., low risk), and vice-versa. To test this hypothesis, we ran simple linear regressions on bat activity rates and fatality rates from 49 paired pre- and post-construction studies across the United States and Canada. Bat activity rates did not predict bat fatality rates at wind energy facilities by detector height, by call frequency category of bats, or by season (P> 0.10). One possible explanation for the lack of a predictive relationship is that bat activity patterns may change between the pre- and post-construction periods if bats are attracted to turbines. Indeed, we found support that bat activity rates increased across call frequency category and season at four wind facilities that had measured hat activity rates before (x = 1.89 bat passes/detector-night) and after turbines were built ((x) over bar = 4.84 bat passes/detector-night). However, simple linear regressions of post-construction activity rates and fatality rates from 25 studies found no correlation between activity and fatality rates collected concurrently by detector height (ground, raised, nacelle) or by call frequency category (P > 0.05). We conclude that the current pre-construction survey methods of collecting bat activity rates at proposed wind energy facilities do not provide reliable information on how many bat fatalities there may be once the facility is built, and advocate exploring other methods for assessing risk to bats prior to wind development.","[Solick, Donald; Pham, Diem; Nasman, Kristen; Bay, Kimberly] Western EcoSyst Technol Environm & Stat Consultan, 2121 Midpoint Dr,Suite 201, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA; [Solick, Donald] Vesper Bat Detect Serv, 1316 Stover St, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA",,"Solick, D (corresponding author), Western EcoSyst Technol Environm & Stat Consultan, 2121 Midpoint Dr,Suite 201, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA.;Solick, D (corresponding author), Vesper Bat Detect Serv, 1316 Stover St, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA.",dsolick@vesperbats.com,,,"Wind Wildlife Research Fund; WEST, Inc.","Wind Wildlife Research Fund; WEST, Inc.","We are grateful to the Wind Wildlife Research Fund for providing financial support to make this work possible.

Using temperate bats, a group of particular conservation concern, we investigated how morphological traits, habitat specialization and environmental variables affect home range sizes and daily foraging movements, using a compilation of 30 years of published bat telemetry data. Location Northern America and Europe. Time period 1988-2016. Major taxa studied Bats. Methods We compiled data on home range size and mean daily distance between roosts and foraging areas at both colony and individual levels from 166 studies of 3,129 radiotracked individuals of 49 bat species. We calculated multi-scale habitat composition and configuration in the surrounding landscapes of the 165 studied roosts. Using mixed models, we examined the effects of habitat availability and spatial arrangement on bat movements, while accounting for body mass, aspect ratio, wing loading and habitat specialization. Results We found a significant effect of landscape composition on home range size and mean daily distance at both colony and individual levels. On average, home ranges were up to 42% smaller in the most habitat-diversified landscapes while mean daily distances were up to 30% shorter in the most forested landscapes. Bat home range size significantly increased with body mass, wing aspect ratio and wing loading, and decreased with habitat specialization. Main conclusions Promoting bat movements through the landscape surrounding roosts at large spatial scales is crucial for bat conservation. Forest loss and overall landscape homogenization lead temperate bats to fly further to meet their ecological requirements, by increasing home range sizes and daily foraging distances. Both processes might be more detrimental for smaller, habitat-specialized bats, less able to travel increasingly longer distances to meet their diverse needs.","[Laforge, Alexis; Sirami, Clelia; Ladet, Sylvie; Barbaro, Luc] Univ Toulouse, Dynafor, INRAE INPT, Auzeville, France; [Laforge, Alexis; Coulon, Aurelie; Froidevaux, Jeremy; Barre, Kevin; Roemer, Charlotte; Claireau, Fabien; Kerbiriou, Christian; Barbaro, Luc] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, MNHN, CESCO, Concarneau, France; [Laforge, Alexis; Gouix, Nicolas] Conservatoire Espaces Nat Occitanie, Toulouse, France; [Archaux, Frederic; Martin, Hilaire] INRAE, EFNO, Nogent Sur Vernisson, France; [Coulon, Aurelie; Roemer, Charlotte] Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS, CEFE, Montpellier, France; [Froidevaux, Jeremy] Univ Stirling, Fac Nat Sci, Stirling, Scotland; [Claireau, Fabien] Naturalia Environm, Site Agroparc, Avignon, France",Universite de Toulouse; INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Sorbonne Universite; INRAE; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; University of Stirling,"Laforge, A; Barbaro, L (corresponding author), INRAE Toulouse, Dynafor, Chemin Borde Rouge,Auzeville CS 52627, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, Auzeville, France.",alexis.laforge@yahoo.fr; barbaro@inrae.fr,"Archaux, Frédéric/M-5242-2014; Froidevaux, Jeremy/AAB-6213-2019; Roemer, Charlotte/GYJ-3781-2022","laforge, alexis/0000-0003-2434-4142; Froidevaux, Jeremy/0000-0001-6850-4879; Barre, Kevin/0000-0001-5368-4053; Nicolas, Gouix/0000-0002-9746-1174",DREAL Occitanie; ANRT CIFRE [2016/1063],"DREAL Occitanie; ANRT CIFRE(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Agence Nationale Des Plantes Medicinales Et Aromatiques, ANPMA, MoroccoAgence nationale pour le developpement de la recherche en sante (ANDRS))","We warmly thanks Yves Bas, Aurelien Besnard, Vincent Devictor, Jean-Francois Julien, Fabien Laroche, Isabelle Le Viol, Daniel Marc, Julie Marmet, Eric Petit and Laurent Tillon for their help and advice at various stages of the study.

However, the ecological drivers of wildlife roadkills are not yet fully explored. We investigated the strength of landscape features and ecomorphological traits in determining spatial patterns of bat roadkills in Taiwan. In total, 661 roadkills that belonged to 20 bat species were acquired by citizen scientists between 2011 and 2019. The number and species richness of victim bats declined with increasing elevations with varying species compositions. Elevation and artificial light had significantly negative effects on the occurrence of roadkill, whereas protected area and its interaction with elevation had positive effects. Ordination analyses showed that roadkills were driven by different ecomorphological traits and landscape features. At low elevations, road casualties were associated with an aerial hawking hunting strategy. At higher elevations, roadkills were associated with higher elevational distribution. Roadkills of non-cave bats were associated with brighter environments, suggesting that bats might be exposed to higher risk when hunting insects near artificial light. Our findings suggest that management agencies shall consider both species traits and landscape features when planning impact assessments and mitigation practices of roadkills for bats and probably other wildlife, particularly when long environmental gradients are covered.","[Huang, Joe Chun-Chia] Southeast Asian Bat Conservat Res Unit, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Chen, Wan-Jyun] Endem Species Res Inst, Div Habitats & Ecosyst, 1 Ming Shen East Rd, Nantou 552, Taiwan; [Chen, Wan-Jyun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Lin, Te-En] Endem Species Res Inst, Div Zool, 1 Ming Shen East Rd, Nantou 552, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Huang, JCC (corresponding author), Southeast Asian Bat Conservat Res Unit, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.;Lin, TE (corresponding author), Endem Species Res Inst, Div Zool, 1 Ming Shen East Rd, Nantou 552, Taiwan.",ecojoe.huang@gmail.com; jyun@tesri.gov.tw; dnlin@tesri.gov.tw,"Huang, Joe/AAG-9365-2019; Lin, Te-En/GPF-3580-2022","Chen, Wan-Jyun/0000-0002-5658-6464; Lin, Te-En/0000-0002-0920-4937; Huang, Joe Chun-Chia/0000-0001-5081-5900","Environmental Protection Administration Executive Yuan, Taiwan [103AS-7.4.1-EI-W1, 104AS-7.4.1-EI-W1, 105AS-7.5.1-EI-W1, 106AS-7.3.1-EI-W1, 107AS-6.2.1-EI-W1, 108AS-6.2.1-EI-W1, 109AS-6.2.1-EI-W1]","Environmental Protection Administration Executive Yuan, Taiwan","The operation of Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network was funded by the Environmental Protection Administration Executive Yuan, Taiwan, to T.-E.L., grant numbers 103AS-7.4.1-EI-W1, 104AS-7.4.1-EI-W1, 105AS-7.5.1-EI-W1, 106AS-7.3.1-EI-W1, 107AS-6.2.1-EI-W1, 108AS-6.2.1-EI-W1, and 109AS-6.2.1-EI-W1.",,87,6,6,1,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,MAR,2021,13,3,,,,,,,117,10.3390/d13030117,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d13030117,,,20,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RD6AM,,gold,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000633558300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the goal of identifying bats in flight from their echolocation calls is not always possible. Unlike bird songs, bat calls show large variation that often makes identification challenging. The problem has not been fully overcome by modern digital-based hardware and software for bat call recording and analysis. Besides providing fundamental insights into bat physiology, ecology, and behavior, a better understanding of call variation is therefore crucial to best recognize limits and perspectives of call classification. We provide a comprehensive overview of sources of interspecific and intraspecific echolocation call variations, illustrating its adaptive significance and highlighting gaps in knowledge. We remark that further research is needed to better comprehend call variation and control for it more effectively in sound analysis. Despite the state-of-art technology in this field, combining acoustic surveys with capture and roost search, as well as limiting identification to species with distinctive calls, still represent the safest way of conducting bat surveys.","[Russo, Danilo; Ancillotto, Leonardo] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Wildlife Res Unit, I-80055 Portici, Italy; [Russo, Danilo] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Jones, Gareth] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England",University of Naples Federico II; University of Bristol; University of Bristol,"Russo, D (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Wildlife Res Unit, I-80055 Portici, Italy.;Russo, D (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.",danrusso@unina.it,,,Symposium organization,Symposium organization,"This review arises from a talk given by D.R. at Learning to Listen - Second International Symposium on Bat Echolocation Research: Tools, Techniques, and Analysis.

In this study, paramyxoviruses were investigated by reverse transcription semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-semi-nested PCR) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), based on the RT-semi-nested PCR using the consensus paramyxovirus primers targeting the RNA dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) region. In addition, RT-PCR was performed using newly designed primers targeting regions of the fusion protein (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN). The dominant bat species in the collection site of paramyxoviruses wereMiniopterus schreibersii,Myotis macrodactylus, Myotis petax, andRhinolophus ferrumequinum. Paramyxoviruses were detected in four samples in 2016 and six in 2019. Meanwhile, in samples collected in 2017 and 2018, no paramyxoviruses were detected.

Field data were obtained between May 2018 to November 2019 and 80 individuals were captured, from which 395 bat flies were extracted. Four species of bat flies were registered: Strebla wiedemanni Kolenati, 1856, Trichobius parasiticus Gervais, 1844, T. joblingi Wenzel, 1966 and T. caecus Edwards, 1948. Trichobius parasiticus presented the highest prevalence and mean intensity, followed by S. wiedemanni. Trichobius joblingi and T. caecus are new records of parasitism on D. rotundus for Honduras, although we consider as an accidental association. We recorded six types of infracommunities that parasitized 85% of the hosts.

These characteristics contribute for them being natural reservoirs and part of the epidemiological cycle of several potentially zoonotic pathogens, such as viruses, protozoa, fungi and bacteria. Brazil hosts approximately 15% of the world's bat diversity, with 181 distinct species, 68 genera and 9 families. About 60% of infectious diseases in humans are of zoonotic origin and, in the last decades, the detection of zoonotic pathogens in bats and their environment has been reported, such as Rabies virus (RABV) and Histoplasma capsulatum. Thus, the aim of this work was to review the reports of zoonotic pathogens associated with bats in Brazil in the past ten years. We reviewed the main pathogenic microorganisms described and the species of bats most frequently involved in the epidemiological cycles of these zoonotic agents. The obtained data show an upward trend in the detection of zoonotic pathogens in Brazilian bats, such as RABV, Bartonella sp., Histoplasma capsulatum and Leishmania spp., with emphasis on the bat species Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Desmodus rotundus and Molossus molossus. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring bat-associated microrganisms to early identify pathogens that may threaten bat populations, including potentially zoonotic microrganisms, emphasizing the importance of the One Health approach to pre-vent and mitigate the risks of the emergence of zoonotic diseases.","[Castelo-Branco, D.

Bats, in particular, host an array of zoonotic pathogens, yet there is little research on how bats and humans interact, how people perceive bats and their accompanying disease risk, or who is most at risk. Eidolon helvum, the largest and most abundant African fruit bat species, is widely hunted and eaten in Ghana and also carries potentially zoonotic pathogens. This combination raises concerns, as hunting and butchering bushmeat are common sources of zoonotic transmission. Through a combination of interviews with 577 Ghanaians across southern Ghana, we identified the characteristics of people involved in the bat-bushmeat trade and we explored their perceptions of risk. Bat hunting, selling and consumption are widely distributed across regional and ethnic lines, with hotspots in certain localities, while butchering is predominantly done by women and active hunters. Interviewees held little belief of disease risk from bats, saw no ecological value in fruit bats and associated the consumption of bats with specific tribes. These data can be used to inform disease and conservation management plans, drawing on social contexts and ensuring that local voices are heard within the larger global effort to study and mitigate outbreaks.","[Kamins, Alexandra O.; Wood, James L.

We wanted to know whether the type of agricultural activity in forest-agricultural landscapes affects how species composition as well as taxonomic and functional dimensions of diversity respond. We worked in the Amazon forests of southeast Peru and used bats as model organisms. We sampled mosaics characterized by forest adjacent to papaya plantations or cattle pastures. At each sampling site we established a transect in each of the three different vegetation types: forest interior, forest edge and agricultural land. We found that vegetation type was a better predictor of species composition than the type of agricultural land present. Vegetation structure characteristics explained differences in bat species composition between forest interior and edge. Agricultural land type chosen was not irrelevant as we found higher estimated species richness in papaya than in pasture sites. Agricultural land type present in a site and vegetation type affected functional diversity, with both agricultural land types showing a lower number of functionally distinct species than forests. We found papaya plantation sites showed species more evenly dispersed in trait space, suggesting they do better at conserving functional diversity when compared to cattle pasture sites. We demonstrate that sites that harbor agricultural activities can maintain a considerable proportion of the expected bat diversity. We note that this region still has large tracts of intact forest adjacent to agricultural lands, which may explain their ability to maintain relatively high levels bat diversity.","[Carrasco-Rueda, Farah] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 103 Black Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Carrasco-Rueda, Farah] Field Museum Nat Hist, Keller Sci Act Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Loiselle, Bette A.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, 110 Newins Ziegler Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Loiselle, Bette A.] Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, 319 Grinter Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago); State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Carrasco-Rueda, F (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 103 Black Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;Carrasco-Rueda, F (corresponding author), Field Museum Nat Hist, Keller Sci Act Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",farahcarrasco@gmail.com; loiselleb@ufl.edu,"; Loiselle, Bette/O-7106-2016","Carrasco-Rueda, Farah/0000-0003-1686-2249; Loiselle, Bette/0000-0003-1434-4173",Lewis and Clark Fund for Exploration and Field Research Grant by the American Philosophical Society; Cleveland Zoological Society (CZS); Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (CMZ); Bat Conservation International,Lewis and Clark Fund for Exploration and Field Research Grant by the American Philosophical Society; Cleveland Zoological Society (CZS); Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (CMZ); Bat Conservation International,"Funds for this research were provided by Lewis and Clark Fund for Exploration and Field Research Grant by the American Philosophical Society, Cleveland Zoological Society (CZS) and Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (CMZ), and Bat Conservation International.

However, how parasite population genetic structure is shaped by the interaction between host and parasite life history remains understudied. Studies comparing multiple parasites infecting a single host can be used to investigate how different parasite life history traits interplay with host behaviour and life history. In this study, we used 10 newly developed microsatellite loci to investigate the genetic structure of a parasitic bat fly (Basilia nana). Its host, the Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii), has a social system and roosting behaviour that restrict opportunities for parasite transmission. We compared fly genetic structure to that of the host and another parasite, the wing-mite, Spinturnix bechsteini. We found little spatial or temporal genetic structure in B.nana, suggesting a large, stable population with frequent genetic exchange between fly populations from different bat colonies. This contrasts sharply with the genetic structure of the wing-mite, which is highly substructured between the same bat colonies as well as temporally unstable. Our results suggest that although host and parasite life history interact to yield similar transmission patterns in both parasite species, the level of gene flow and eventual spatiotemporal genetic stability is differentially affected. This can be explained by the differences in generation time and winter survival between the flies and wing-mites. Our study thus exemplifies that the population genetic structure of parasites on a single host can vary strongly as a result of how their individual life history characteristics interact with host behaviour and life history traits.","[van Schaik, J.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Dekeukeleire, D.] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Terr Ecol Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Dekeukeleire, D.; Kerth, G.] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Museum & Inst Zool, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany",Max Planck Society; Ghent University; Universitat Greifswald,"van Schaik, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, Eberhard Gwinner Str, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany.",jvschaik@orn.mpg.de,"van Schaik, Jaap/H-5180-2019","van Schaik, Jaap/0000-0003-4825-7676","Volkswagen Stiftung [Az 84 871, Az 84 959]",Volkswagen Stiftung(Volkswagen),"We would like to thank Daniela Fleischmann, Markus Melber, Karsten Reckardt and many others for their help collecting samples; Ina Romer, Alain Frantz and Sebastien Puechmaille for their help in the laboratory and with data analysis; and Pascal Hablutzel, Serena Dool and five anonymous referees for their useful comments on the manuscript.

However, studies that examine the use of ponds by terrestrial wildlife are limited. In the boreal forest, aquatic habitats are important drinking and feeding habitat for endangered little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), and their relative value likely varies based on their characteristics, such as size, adjacent land cover type, anthropogenic disturbance, and proximity to other water bodies. We examined the characteristics of ponds used by little brown bats along an urban-rural gradient in Yukon, Canada. We used ultrasonic detectors to sample 99 ponds and generalized linear mixed models to determine whether ponds with certain characteristics received more bat activity than others. Ponds were important habitat for little brown bats, as 98% of the ponds we sampled were used. Bats selected ponds based on local rather than landscape level factors, and there was less bat activity at ponds surrounded by additional open water/wetland habitat, which was contrary to our prediction. Ponds that were surrounded by additional open water/wetland habitat may have been too exposed for bats at high latitudes, where nights are short and not completely dark. Isolated ponds that are darker, such as those surrounded by mature forest, may be particularly valuable for little brown bats at high latitudes that exhibit risk-sensitive foraging. We suggest that ponds of comparatively high value for endangered little brown bats be further identified and that these ponds be protected from development, draining, and degradation, and the surrounding mature forest remains intact. More broadly, recognition and conservation of ponds and their surroundings as key habitat for species of bats requires further attention. Understanding the characteristics of ponds selected by threatened bats can help inform conservation priorities and measures that ensure the aquatic habitats they require are maintained in developing landscapes.","[Kukka, Piia M.; Miller, Hannah A.; Thomas, Julie P.; Jung, Thomas S.] Dept Environm, Govt Yukon, Whitehorse, YT, Canada; [Thomas, Julie P.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Schmiegelow, Fiona K.

We review published studies globally from both complementary approaches. We further present an economic model for the avoided cost of bat predation on stinkbugs, the major economic pest of macadamias in South Africa, currently the world's largest macadamia producer. We calculated both the direct (reduced stinkbug damage due to bat predation) and indirect (reduced pesticide use) avoided costs. We estimated the density of bats in a macadamia-growing region of South Africa to be 7.5-22.5 bats/ha, based on opportunistic data from the Merlin DeTEct (Inc.) avian-avoidance radar system. Current economic parameters for macadamia production, stinkbug injury coefficients and life history were obtained from the literature and from the Southern African Macadamia Association (SAMAC).We estimated the level of bat predation on pest stink bugs in macadamia orchards from published dietary studies combined with both high and low published values for insect consumption rates relative to bat body mass. We found that the protected yield due to bat predation of stink bugs amounted to 0.53% (low consumption rates) to 1.29% (high consumption rates) of annual macadamia production in South Africa for 2015. Based on current macadamia prices, the approximate avoided cost values of these combined direct and indirect bat predation services varied between 9% and 23% of the current annual estimated cost of damage caused by stinkbugs to South African macadamia orchards (US$613/ha). Losing bats to disease epidemics, wind farms, human persecution or excessive or highly toxic pesticide applications could therefore significantly increase annual losses to the macadamia industry in South Africa caused by stinkbugs.

We took advantage of 12 captive births in a study colony of vampire bats to test the role of past experience in two aspects of feeding. First, we compared preferences for blood temperature in 32 wild-born vampire bats versus 11 captive-born vampire bats that had only previously fed on blood of ambient temperature or colder. We found no evidence for a preference in either group for blood presented at 4 degrees C versus 37 degrees C. Second, we tested whether captive-born vampire bats with no previous experience of feeding on live animals could successfully feed on a live chicken. Five of 12 naive captive-born bats were able to bite the chicken and draw blood, but only one bat gained more than 5% of body mass. We were unable to reasonably compare their feeding performance with that of wild-born bats because only two of three wild-born, short-term captive bats fed on the chicken and none of the seven wild-born, long-term captive mothers attempted to feed. This unexpected lack of feeding might be due to a previously reported age-dependent neophobia. When six of the captive-born bats were released in the wild, they appeared to feed successfully because they survived for more than three consecutive nights. We suggest further tests that would better clarify the role of learning in the development of foraging in vampire bats.","[Berrio-Martinez, Jineth; Kaiser, Samuel; Nowak, Michelle; Page, Rachel A.; Carter, Gerald G.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; [Carter, Gerald G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Carter, GG (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama.;Carter, GG (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",carter.1640@osu.edu,"Page, Rachel/AAE-4816-2021; Page, Rachel/GQQ-2818-2022","Page, Rachel/0000-0001-7072-0669; Berrio-Martinez, Jineth/0000-0002-6137-6680",Smithsonian Postdoctoral Fellowship; Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Studies Grant: 'Tracking and manipulating cooperative relationships in vampire bats',Smithsonian Postdoctoral Fellowship(Smithsonian Institution); Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Studies Grant: 'Tracking and manipulating cooperative relationships in vampire bats',"Gerald Carter was supported by a Smithsonian Postdoctoral Fellowship.

This study investigates the impact of development on the diet composition of three horseshoe bats: Rhinolophus euryale, R. hipposideros, and R. ferrumequinum in the Basque Country, north of the Iberian Peninsula. The diets of juvenile and adult individuals of each species were obtained by analysing their droppings using metabarcoding and then compared at (1) the taxonomic and (2) prey trait levels (size, flying speed, hardness). The diets of juvenile and adult individuals of R. euryale and R. hipposideros showed significant differences at the taxonomic level and regarding prey traits. In contrast, in the case of R. ferrumequinum, we could only observe discernible diet patterns through the trait analysis. Additionally, we discovered a shared pattern: younger individuals tend to feed on easier-to-hunt and/or handle smaller and smoother prey. The varying degrees of dissimilarity between juvenile and adult diets observed in this study suggest that the relative importance of psychomotor development, foraging strategies, prey discrimination, and/or spatial learning may differ among species. These findings contribute to conservation efforts, especially by recognising the dietary needs of juveniles for their survival and successful development.","[Aldasoro, Miren; Vallejo, Nerea; Olasagasti, Lander; de Cerio, Oihane Diaz; Aihartza, Joxerra] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Zool & Anim Cell Biol, Sarriena Z-G, E-48940 Leioa, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Aldasoro, M (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Zool & Anim Cell Biol, Sarriena Z-G, E-48940 Leioa, Spain.",miren.aldasoro@ehu.eus; nerea.vallejo@ehu.eus; lander.olasagasti@ehu.eus; oihane.diazdecerio@ehu.eus; joxerra.aihartza@ehu.eus,"Vallejo, Nerea/GSO-3480-2022; Diaz de cerio, Oihane/H-3336-2015","Diaz de cerio, Oihane/0000-0002-5605-8434; Vallejo, Nerea/0000-0002-1478-1536; Aldasoro, Miren/0000-0002-7393-3878","MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 [PID2019-108123GB-I00, MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033]; EU [IT1571-22, 049-2022-42]",MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033; EU(European Union (EU)),"This work was funded by grant PID2019-108123GB-I00 funded by MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and the EU, as well as by the Basque Government (Research grant IT1571-22) and its Biodiversity Directorate (Expedient No 049-2022-42).",,98,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,NOV,2024,14,22,,,,,,,3303,10.3390/ani14223303,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani14223303,,,17,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,N3S0M,39595355,gold,,,2025-02-11,WOS:001363564900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Bat flies themselves can be parasitized by Laboulbeniales, fungal biotrophs of arthropods. This is known as hyperparasitism, a severely understudied phenomenon. Three genera of Laboulbeniales occur on bat flies: Arthrorhynchus on Nycteribiidae, Gloeandromyces and Nycteromyces on Streblidae. In this review we introduce the parasitic partners in this tripartite system and discuss their diversity, ecology, and specificity patterns, alongside some important life history traits. Furthermore, we cover recent advances in the study of the associations between bat flies and Laboulbeniales, which were neglected for decades.

Eidolon helvum is also a known reservoir for potentially zoonotic viruses. Despite E. helvum's importance, ecological and behavioural traits are poorly described for this species. Here we present extensive data on the distribution, migration patterns, roost size, age and sex composition of 29 E. helvum roosts from nine countries across tropical Africa, including roosts not previously described in the literature. Roost age and sex composition were dependent on timing of sampling relative to the annual birth pulse. Rather than a single 'breeding season' as is frequently reported for this species, regional asynchrony of reproductive timing was observed across study sites (with birth pulses variably starting in March, April, September, November or December). Considered together with its genetic panmixia, we conclude that the species has a fluid, fission-fusion social structure, resulting in different roost 'types' at different times of the year relative to seasonal reproduction. Bat-human interactions also varied across the species' geographical range. In the absence of significant hunting, large urban colonies were generally tolerated, yet in regions with high hunting pressure, bats tended to roost in remote or protected sites. The extensive quantitative and qualitative data presented in this manuscript are also valuable for a wide range of studies and provide an historical snapshot as its populations become increasingly threatened.","[Peel, Alison J.; Wood, James L.

When stimulated with single pulses, 56 (55%) neurons discharged 1 or 2 impulses (phasic responders), 42 (42%) discharged 3-10 impulses (phasic bursters) and 3 (3%) discharged impulses throughout the stimulus duration (tonic responders). Bicuculline application increased the number of impulses and changed the discharge patterns of 66 neurons. Using 50% difference between maximal and minimal responses as a criterion, the duration tuning characteristics of these neurons can be described as band-pass (20, 20%), long-pass (17, 17%), short-pass (33, 32%), and all-pass (31, 31%). Each band-pass neuron discharged maximally to a specific duration (the best duration) which was at least 50% larger than the neuron's responses to a long-duration pulse and a short-duration pulse. In contrast, each long- or short-pass neuron discharged maximally to a range of long or short duration pulses. Bicuculline application changed the duration tuning characteristics of 65 neurons. Possible mechanisms underlying duration tuning characteristics and the behavioral relevance to bat echolocation are discussed.","Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",pjen@biosci.mbp.missouri.edu,,,,,,,52,66,76,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0340-7594,1432-1351,,J COMP PHYSIOL A,J.

Flowers of the African sausage tree Kigelia africana are visited by bats and bush babies during the night and by birds during the day. We studied floral traits (phenophases, scent, color, and nectar chemistry) and the visitation frequency and pollination effectiveness of different flower visitors to determine whether K. africana is functionally specialized for bat pollination. We found that flower opening corresponds with bat activity, flowers emit scent dominated by aliphatic esters and alcohols, and that nectar is produced in copious amounts accessible to bats. Pollen deposition on stigmas was twenty-fold greater per visit by bats than it was per visit by birds, likely a result of the close morphological fit between snouts of bats and the flowers. However, bat visits appear to be rare at some sites and the delayed senescence of flowers that are open throughout the morning provides an opportunity for additional pollination by birds. We conclude that K. africana is primarily adapted for bat pollination, but is also able to exploit other animals for pollination.","[Newman, Ethan; Govender, Keeveshnee; van Niekerk, Sandy; Johnson, Steven D.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Ctr Funct Biodivers, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Newman, Ethan] Rhodes Univ, Dept Bot, Grahamstown, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; Rhodes University,"Newman, E (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Ctr Funct Biodivers, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",e.newman@ru.ac.za,"Johnson, Steven/P-2104-2019; Johnson, Steven/F-1146-2010","Newman, Ethan/0000-0002-9678-4895; Johnson, Steven/0000-0002-5114-5862",National Research Foundation [46372],National Research Foundation,"National Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 46372",,53,9,9,3,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0006-3606,1744-7429,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,MAR,2021,53,2,,,,,477,486,,10.1111/btp.12891,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.12891,,FEB 2021,10,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RA5AB,,,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000613691200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Information concerning Brazil is presented separately because of the abundance of bats species with different feeding habits, involved in the transmission of rabies virus and the complex relationships between epidemiological cycles in this country, which have been disclosed by antigenic typing and phylogenetic analysis.

Swarming in extant trichopterans is well understood in terms of sex composition, specific mating behaviors, and functional morphological specializations of adults, but an exploration of the evolution of such aggregative behaviors is hampered by the dearth of available examples from the fossil record as well as the ability to reliably distinguish the few gatherings as the result of swarming relative to other taphonomic or behavioral factors. Herein we describe five new fossil species of caddisflies preserved in mid-Cretaceous amber from Myanmar, all preserved as large aggregations. Monospecific aggregations of these five new species can be positively identified as swarms based on morphological traits of wing shape, as well as the presence of particular forms of sexual dimorphism. Results of a phylogenetic reconstruction of both molecular and morphological data as well as ancestral-trait reconstructions and tip-dating analyses indicate that swarming was likely present in the Triassic as a feature of the trichopteran groundplan. Since most Mesozoic insectivorous predators were diurnal based on morphological evidence, largely nocturnal caddisflies would have been freed from such pressures. The phylogeny also shows a correlation between the rise of nocturnal bat predators from the Paleocene or early Eocene and the repeated loss of swarming from various clades of caddisflies, revealing the potential impact of bat predation on reshaping the behavioral landscape of Trichoptera during the Cenozoic. The amber fossils show that the swarming behavior of Trichoptera already existed during the Cretaceous.","[Wang, Jiajia; Shih, Chungkun; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiajia] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Inst Zool, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Engel, Michael S.] Div Invertebrate Zool, Amer Museum Nat Hist, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Fac Ciencias Biol, Lima 73457445, Peru; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Dept Entomol, Museo Hist Nat, Lima, Peru; [Zhang, Weiting] Hebei Int Joint Res Ctr Paleoanthropol Hebei GEO U, Shijiazhuang 050031, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Qiu, Rui] Natl Nat Hist Museum China, Beijing 100050, Peoples R China","Capital Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Zoology, CAS; American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos; Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History","Ren, D (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn,"Engel, Michael/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael/0000-0003-3067-077X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42288201, 42202025, 32020103006]; Science and Technology Project of Hebei Education Department [BJ2021011]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [D2020403002]; BJAST Young Scholar Programs [24CE-YS-01]; Special financial support of the Beijing Government; CONCYTEC through the PROCIENCIA program [PE501084299-2023-PROCIENCIA-BM]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Project of Hebei Education Department; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province); BJAST Young Scholar Programs; Special financial support of the Beijing Government; CONCYTEC through the PROCIENCIA program,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42288201, 42202025 and 32020103006), the Science and Technology Project of Hebei Education Department (BJ2021011), the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (D2020403002), the BJAST Young Scholar Programs (24CE-YS-01), and Special financial support of the Beijing Government.

The ultrasonic sound emitted by bats creates a soundscape of fear which can affect moth trait expression and population dynamics via non-consumptive effects. Bat echolocation calls can be categorized as constant frequency (CF), frequency modula-tion (FM), or some combination of both (FM-CF-FM or FM-CF). Different sound characteristics may encode different levels of predation risk for moths and thus result in variable non-consumptive effects. To investigate the non-consumptive effects on moths of different types of bats echolocation calls, we played back three types of calls with distinct characteristics to an agricultural pest species, the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, two CF calls from bats that prey on the moth, and one FM call from a bat that is sympatric with the moth and represents the echolocation sound typical of most insect-eating bats. Our results showed that the FM echolocation calls of the Oriental serotine bat, Eptesicus pachyomus, negatively affected the reproductive behavior of adult S. exigua, and altered larval energy metabolism and consumption. Calls of the big-eared horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus macrotis, with a dominant frequency of 58 kHz, only affected the reproductive behavior of adult S. exigua, whereas calls of the least horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus pusillus, with a dominant frequency of 110 kHz, had no measurable effects on S. exigua. The non-consumptive effects observed included reduced activity frequency, reduced food intake, and increased body weight of the moth in response to the soundscape of fear created by bats. Overall, FM calls with frequency within the moth's hearing range had greater effects on the moths. Our findings indicate that bat calls detectable by moths, whether or not the bats actually hunt them, create a soundscape of fear with negative impacts on moth behavior and life history, and likely make a valuable contribution to pest control.","[Zhou, Ruizhu; Li, Xin; Wang, Qiuya; Wu, Hui; Feng, Jiang] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yue; Feng, Jiang] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China",Jilin Agricultural University; Northeast Normal University - China,"Wu, H; Feng, J (corresponding author), Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China.",wuh123@nenu.edu.cn; Jiangfengj@nenu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [32171489]; Jilin Provincial Natural Science Foundation,China [20200201186JC]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jilin Provincial Natural Science Foundation,China","Acknowledgement This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 32171489) and the Jilin Provincial Natural Science Foundation,China (Grant No. 20200201186JC) .

However, pests pose a significant challenge to the productivity and sustainability of these agricultural systems. The need to reduce the usage of chemical pesticides in agriculture has intensified due to growing public health and environmental concerns. Retaining generalized predators to biologically control pests is commonly considered as an alternative management strategy. Bats are widely acknowledged as highly effective pest suppression agents. However, little is known about how bats contribute to pest suppression services in smallholder farming systems and how different sympatric bat species divide their use of food resources. We employed DNA metabarcoding to determine the differential prey species consumed by seven bat species in Chinese smallholder farming systems to clarify pest suppression services and dietary niche differentiation. We detected 19 orders of arthropods, among which mosquitos (Diptera), moths (Lepidoptera), and beetles (Coleoptera) were the most predominant prey items. We also documented 75 major pests consumed by bats that can potentially damage agricultural areas or spread diseases. Moreover, there was a significant differentiation among the seven sympatric bat species. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis shows that morphological and echolocation traits may explain dietary niche differentiation. Our results suggest that bats play a critical role in pest suppression services in smallholder farming systems and further prove that the dietary niche was significant differentiation among bat species. These results implied that landscape heterogeneity in smallholder farming systems may increase arthropod diversity, in turn increase biological pest control by bats. Thus, our results also highlight the importance of conserving bat populations and their crucial ecosystem services in integrated pest management (IPM), which has significant implications for the potential protection of food security and human health.","[Liu, Yingying; Geng, Yang; Huang, Zhenglanyi; Feng, Jiang; Jiang, Tinglei] Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Prov Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Utili, 2555 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yingying; Geng, Yang; Huang, Zhenglanyi; Feng, Jiang; Jiang, Tinglei] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol Educ Minist, 2555 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China; [Feng, Jiang] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, 2888 Xincheng St, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tinglei] Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Songnen Grassland Ecosyst Natl Observat & Re, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China; Northeast Normal University - China; Jilin Agricultural University; Northeast Normal University - China,"Feng, J; Jiang, TL (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Prov Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Utili, 2555 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China.;Feng, J; Jiang, TL (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol Educ Minist, 2555 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China.;Feng, J (corresponding author), Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, 2888 Xincheng St, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China.;Jiang, TL (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Songnen Grassland Ecosyst Natl Observat & Re, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.",fengj@nenu.edu.cn; jiangtl730@nenu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We are grateful to all plant quarantine officers and farmers who participated in the field surveys.,,100,3,3,8,32,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,,J PEST SCI,J.

If bats in close interaction with humans host and shed coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, spillover may occur. Therefore, strategies aiming to mitigate potential spillover and disease emergence, while supporting the conservation of bats and their important ecological roles are needed. Past research suggests that coronavirus shedding in bats varies seasonally following their reproductive cycle; however, shedding dynamics have been assessed in only a few species, which does not allow for generalization of findings across bat taxa and geographic regions. Methods To assess the generalizability of coronavirus shedding seasonality, we sampled hundreds of bats belonging to several species with different life history traits across East Africa at different times of the year. We assessed, via Bayesian modeling, the hypothesis that chiropterans, across species and spatial domains, experience seasonal trends in coronavirus shedding as a function of the reproductive cycle. Results We found that, beyond spatial, taxonomic, and life history differences, coronavirus shedding is more expected when pups are becoming independent from the dam and that juvenile bats are prone to shed these viruses. Conclusions These findings could guide policy aimed at the prevention of spillover in limited-resource settings, where longitudinal surveillance is not feasible, by identifying high-risk periods for coronavirus shedding. In these periods, contact with bats should be avoided (for example, by impeding or forbidding people access to caves). Our proposed strategy provides an alternative to culling - an ethically questionable practice that may result in higher pathogen levels - and supports the conservation of bats and the delivery of their key ecosystem services.","[Montecino-Latorre, Diego; Goldstein, Tracey; Gilardi, Kirsten; Wolking, David; Van Wormer, Elizabeth; Cranfield, Michael; Mazet, Jonna A.

Between 1977 and 2011, 961 cases of bat rabies were reported to Rabies Bulletin Europe, with the vast majority (>97%) being attributed to EBLV-1. There have been 25 suspected cases of EBLV-2, of which 22 have been confirmed. In addition, two single isolations of unique lyssaviruses from European insectivorous bats were reported in south-west Russia in 2002 (West Caucasian bat virus) and in Germany in 2010 (Bokeloh bat lyssavirus). In this review, we present phylogenetic analyses of the EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 using partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences. In particular, we have analysed all EBLV-2 cases for which viral sequences (N gene, 400 nucleotides) are available (n = 21). Oropharyngeal swabs collected from two healthy Myotis daubentonii during active surveillance programmes in Scotland and Switzerland also yielded viral RNA (EBLV-2). Despite the relatively low number of EBLV-2 cases, a surprisingly large amount of anomalous data has been published in the scientific literature and Genbank, which we have collated and clarified. For both viruses, geographical relationships are clearly defined on the phylogenetic analysis. Whilst there is no clear chronological clustering for either virus, there is some evidence for host specific relationships, particularly for EBLV-1 where more host variation has been observed. Further genomic regions must be studied, in particular for EBLV-1 isolates from Spain and the EBLV-2 isolates to provide support for the existence of sublineages.","[McElhinney, L. M.; Marston, D.

In this scenario, little is known about how animal communities respond to different types of secondary vegetation in the region. We examined the effects of abandoned cattle pasture, Vismia- and Cecropia-dominated regrowth on the abundance of bat species and community composition in the Central Amazon, Brazil, based on 11 netting sites and on landscape characteristics. We captured 1444 bats, representing 26 species and two families (Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae). Among the six most-captured Phyllostomidae bats, Sturnira lilium and Sturnira tildae had significantly higher capture rates in abandoned pasture, while Rhinophylla pumilio predominated in both Vismia- and Cecropia-dominated regrowth. An hybrid multidimensional scaling ordination revealed significant differences in the bat community among the three types of secondary vegetation. Phyllostominae bats were more common and richer in the less-disturbed areas of Cecropia-dominated regrowth, while Stenodermatinae species were more captured in abandoned pastures. Our results suggest that the type of secondary vegetation, together with its land-use history, affects bat community composition in the Central Amazon. The Phyllostominae subfamily (gleaning animalivores) was habitat selective and disappeared from areas experiencing constant disturbances. On the other hand, Stenodermatinae frugivorous bats often used and foraged in altered areas. We suggest that secondary vegetations in more-advanced successional stages can be used to augment the total area protected by forest conservation units.","[Bobrowiec, P. E.

Cranio-muscular morphology determines how wide, forcefully, and quickly the jaw can be opened or closed, which limits the size and material properties of the foods that a mammal can eat. Most studies of feeding performance in mammals have focused on skull form and jaw muscles involved in generating bite force, but few explore how jaw abduction is related to feeding performance. In this study, we explored how the morphology of the digastric muscle, the primary jaw abducting muscle in mammals, and its jaw lever mechanics are related to diet in morphologically diverse noctilionoid bats. Results showed that insectivorous bats have strong digastric muscles associated with proportionally long jaws, which suggests these species can open their jaws quickly and powerfully during prey capture and chewing. Short snouted frugivorous bats exhibit traits that would enable them to open their jaws proportionally wider to accommodate the large fruits that they commonly feed on. Our results support the hypothesis that digastric muscle and jaw morphology are correlated with diet in bats, and that our results may also apply to other groups of mammals.

Animal models can be exploited to learn about the biological underpinnings of shared human traits, and although no other animals display speech or language, a range of behaviors found throughout the animal kingdom are relevant to speech and spoken language. To date, such investigations have been dominated by studies of our closest primate relatives searching for shared traits, or more distantly related species that are sophisticated vocal communicators, like songbirds. Herein I make the case for turning our attention to the Chiropterans, to shed new light on the biological encoding and evolution of human language-relevant traits. Bats employ complex vocalizations to facilitate navigation as well as social interactions, and are exquisitely tuned to acoustic information. Furthermore, bats display behaviors such as vocal learning and vocal turn-taking that are directly pertinent for human spoken language. Emerging technologies are now allowing the study of bat vocal communication, from the behavioral to the neurobiological and molecular level. Although it is clear that no single animal model can reflect the complexity of human language, by comparing such findings across diverse species we can identify the shared biological mechanisms likely to have influenced the evolution of human language.","[Vernes, Sonja C.] Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Vernes, Sonja C.] Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Max Planck Society; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Vernes, SC (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Nijmegen, Netherlands.;Vernes, SC (corresponding author), Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",sonja.vernes@mpi.nl,"Vernes, Sonja/E-8454-2012","Vernes, Sonja/0000-0003-0305-4584",Max Planck Society (Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics); Marie Curie Career Integration Grant; Max Planck Research Group Grant,Max Planck Society (Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics); Marie Curie Career Integration Grant(Marie Curie Actions); Max Planck Research Group Grant,"Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society (Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics).

Free-tailed bats (Molossidae) show a distribution with a maximum latitudinal extension that appears to be intermediate between truly tropical and temperate-zone bat families. We therefore tested the hypothesis that Tadarida teniotis, the molossid species reaching the highest latitude worldwide (46 degrees N), lacks the extreme physiological adaptations to cold that enable other sympatric bats to enter further into the temperate zone. We studied the metabolism of individuals subjected to various ambient temperatures in the laboratory by respirometry, and we monitored the body temperature of free-ranging individuals in winter and early spring in the Swiss Alps using temperature-sensitive radio-tags. For comparison, metabolic data were obtained from Nyctalus noctula, a typically hibernating vespertilionid bat of similar body size and convergent foraging tactics. The metabolic data support the hypothesis that T. teniotis cannot experience such low ambient temperatures as sympatric temperate-zone vespertilionid bats without incurring much higher energetic costs for thermogenesis. The minimum rate of metabolism in torpor was obtained at 7.5 degrees-10 degrees C in T. teniotis, as compared to 2.5 degrees-5 degrees C in N. noctula. Field data showed that T. teniotis behaves as a classic thermo-conforming hibernator in the Alps, with torpor bouts lasting up to 8 d. This contradicts the widely accepted opinion that Molossidae are nonhibernating bars. However, average body temperature (10 degrees-13 degrees C) and mean arousal frequency (3.4 d in one bat in January) appear to be markedly higher than in other temperate-zone bat species. At the northern border of its range T. teniotis selects relatively warm roosts (crevices in tall, south-exposed limestone cliffs) in winter where temperatures oscillate around 10 degrees C. By this means, T. teniotis apparently avoids the risk of prolonged exposure to energetically critical ambient temperatures in torpor (<6.5 degrees-7.5 degrees C) during cold spells. Possibly shared by other Molossidae, the physiological pattern observed in T. teniotis may clearly be linked to the intermediate latitudinal extension of this bat family.","Univ Lausanne, Inst Zool & Anim Ecol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Arlettaz, R (corresponding author), Nat Ctr, CH-3970 Salgesch, Switzerland.",Raphael.Arlettaz@ie-zea.unil.ch,"Arlettaz, Raphael/O-2182-2016","Arlettaz, Raphael/0000-0001-6360-5339",,,,,33,71,82,0,55,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,1004,1014,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[1004:PTATDA]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[1004:PTATDA]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,,,,,2025-02-11,WOS:000086351500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

This phylogeny was derived by combining 105 estimates of bat phylogenetic relationships published since 1970 using the supertree construction technique of Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP). Despite the explosive growth in the number of phylogenetic studies of bats since 1990, phylogenetic relationships in the order have been studied non-randomly. For example, over one-third of all bat systematic studies to date have focused on relationship within Phyllostomidae, whereas relationships within clades such as Kerivoulinae and Murinae have never been studied using cladistic methods. Resolution in the supertree similarly differs among clades: overall resolution is poor (46.4% of a fully bifurcating solution) but reaches 100% in some groups (e.g. relationships within Mormoopidae). The supertree analysis does not support a recent proposal that Microchiroptera is paraphyletic with respect to Megachiroptera, as the majority of source topologies support microbat monophyly. Although it is not a substitute for comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of primary molecular and morphological data, the bat supertree provides a useful tool for future phylogenetic comparative and macroevolutionary studies. Additionally, it identifies clades that have been studied, highlights groups within which relationships are controversial, and like all phylogenetic studies, provides preliminary hypotheses that can form starting points for future phylogenetic studies of bats.","Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Zool Mammal, New York, NY 10024 USA; Leiden Univ, Inst Evolutionary & Ecol Sci, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; Univ Surrey, Sch Life Sci, London SW15 3SN, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England",American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; University of Surrey; Imperial College London,"Jones, KE (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",kate.jones@virginia.edu,"Jones, Kate/Y-3317-2019; MacLarnon, Ann/JDW-8867-2023; Bininda-Emonds, Olaf/C-5405-2008; Jones, Kate/G-4768-2010; Purvis, Andy/A-7529-2008","MacLarnon, Ann/0000-0003-2722-4998; Simmons, Nancy B./0000-0001-8807-7499; Bininda-Emonds, Olaf/0000-0003-4432-224X; Jones, Kate/0000-0001-5231-3293; Purvis, Andy/0000-0002-8609-6204",,,,,194,272,321,2,136,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

The underlying causes for the longevity of bats and the question whether bats exhibit signs of senescence - a progressive deterioration in performance - are still unclear. Here, we describe rates of senescence in individual annual fitness, survival and reproduction using survival and recruitment data collected over an 18-yr period from 77 males and 81 females in a wild population of Saccopteryx bilineata (greater sac-winged bat), a polygynous species inhabiting colonies where female groups are defended each by a territorial male. In individuals older than 4yr of age, individual fitness contribution, survival and recruitment declined with increasing age in males but not in females. Rates of senescence in annual individual fitness and in reproduction of males were at least an order of magnitude higher than those of females. This finding might be explained by the disposable soma theory' that attributes senescence to an optimal allocation of resources to somatic maintenance and competing traits such as reproduction. The rate of senescence in the survival of males was also significant but of the same order of magnitude as the (non-significant) rate of females. Unlike many other polygynous mammals, greater sac-winged bats show little overt male-male competition. As senescence in survival was only weak in males, our results are consistent with the theories for polygynous mammals, which view the trade-off between male investment in physical traits for intense male-male competition against survival as a major source of the decline of male survival with age. This is the first study to demonstrate sex-specific senescence rates in a wild population of a small, long-lived mammalian species.","[Greiner, Sabine; Hofer, Heribert; Voigt, Christian C.] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Berlin, Germany; [Nagy, Martina; Mayer, Frieder] Humboldt Univ, Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Knoernschild, Mirjam] Univ Ulm, Inst Expt Ecol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Zoo und Wildtierforschung; Leibniz Institut fur Evolutions und Biodiversitatsforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin; Ulm University,"Greiner, S (corresponding author), Phys Tech Bundesanstalt, Bundesallee 100, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",greiner@izw-berlin.de,"Hofer, Heribert/AAF-7854-2021; Knörnschild, Mirjam/C-9401-2011; Nagy, Martina/D-2636-2012","Hofer, Heribert/0000-0002-2813-7442; Nagy, Martina/0000-0002-9768-3930","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Vo 890]; DAAD; Ilse and Dr. Alexander Mayer Stiftung; German Merit Foundation; Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Ilse and Dr. Alexander Mayer Stiftung; German Merit Foundation; Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin","The authors thank all colleagues who contributed to data collection.

Many of the threats bats face (e.g., habitat loss, bushmeat hunting, and climate change) reflect the conservation challenges of our era. However, compared to other mammals and birds, we know significantly less about the population status of most bat species, which makes prioritizing and planning conservation actions challenging. Over a third of bat species assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are considered threatened or data deficient, and well over half of the species have unknown or decreasing population trends. That equals 988 species, or 80% of bats assessed by IUCN, needing conservation or research attention. Delivering conservation to bat species will require sustained efforts to assess population status and trends and address data deficiencies. Successful bat conservation must integrate research and conservation to identify stressors and their solutions and to test the efficacy of actions to stabilize or increase populations. Global and regional networks that connect researchers, conservation practitioners, and local stakeholders to share knowledge, build capacity, and prioritize and coordinate research and conservation efforts, are vital to ensuring sustainable bat populations worldwide.","[Frick, Winifred F.; Flanders, Jon] Bat Conservat Int, 500 North Capital Texas Hwy Bldg 1, Austin, TX 78746 USA; [Frick, Winifred F.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Kingston, Tigga] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Flanders, Jon] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Bristol,"Frick, WF (corresponding author), Bat Conservat Int, 500 North Capital Texas Hwy Bldg 1, Austin, TX 78746 USA.",wfrick@batcon.org,"Frick, Winifred/ABA-3519-2020","Flanders, Jon/0000-0001-7296-9601; Frick, Winifred/0000-0002-9469-1839; Kingston, Tigga/0000-0003-3552-5352",,,,,196,351,411,25,317,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0077-8923,1749-6632,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.

Effects are reported for many species groups, and include changes in presence, behaviour, physiology and life-history traits. Among these, bats are strongly affected, and how bat species react to light is likely to vary with light colour. Different spectra may therefore be applied to reduce negative impacts. We used a unique set-up of eight field sites to study the response of bats to three different experimental light spectra in an otherwise dark and undisturbed natural habitat. We measured activity of three bat species groups around transects with light posts emitting white, green and red light with an intensity commonly used to illuminate countryside roads. The results reveal a strong and spectrum-dependent response for the slow flying Myotis and Plecotus and more agile Pipistrellus species, but not for Nyctalus and Eptesicus species. Plecotus and Myotis species avoided white and green light, but were equally abundant in red light and darkness. The agile, opportunistically feeding Pipistrellus species were significantly more abundant around white and green light, most likely because of accumulation of insects, but equally abundant in red illuminated transects compared to dark control. Forest-dwelling Myotis and Plecotus species and more synanthropic Pipistrellus species are thus least disturbed by red light. Hence, in order to limit the negative impact of light at night on bats, white and green light should be avoided in or close to natural habitat, but red lights may be used if illumination is needed.","[Spoelstra, Kamiel; Ramakers, Jip J.

The only extant volant vertebrates, bats and birds have undergone dramatic adaptive radiations that have allowed them to occupy diverse ecological niches and colonize most of the planet. However, few studies have compared the physiology and ecology of these ecologically, and medically, important taxa. Here, we review convergent traits in the physiology, immunology, flight-related ecology of birds and bats that might enable these taxa to act as viral reservoirs and asymptomatic carriers. Many species of birds and bats are well adapted to urban environments and may host more zoonotic pathogens than species that do not colonize anthropogenic habitats.

This highly radiated group embodies many distinct ecomorphological traits, prompting their functional diversity. Furthermore, bat assemblages typically have high beta-diversity due to distinctive compositions across geographic gradients. We aimed to understand the distribution of multifaceted bat diversity metrics (i.e. species richness, functional richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, and local contribution to beta-diversity) as a function of land-cover variables, environmental productivity and complexity, and anthropogenic features in the largest Tropical country worldwide: Brazil. We gathered data on bat distribution based on empirical published datasets and embodied the assemblages at the metacommunity scale, based on 10-km radial clusters. We obtained spatial data on land cover, gross primary production, vegetation height, and human population density for the same radial clusters. We analysed the data via diversity metrics, descriptive statistics, and generalised additive models. Our results showed that two main metaregions (central-western Amazon and the Atlantic coast) embrace the largest richness of bat species. The major positive predictor of bat diversity metrics was vegetation height. Bat diversity metrics throughout Brazil were also significantly influenced by agriculture (negatively) and urban cover (partially positively). We can conclude that bat diversity is more predictable from vegetation height and landscape features - especially agriculture and urban cover - at the metacommunity scale, whereas functional and local contributions to beta-diversity metrics are more predictable from spatial autocorrelations, with some biome-induced constrained effects. For the conservation of Brazilian bats and the many ecosystem services they provide, it is absolutely essential to prevent the further collapse of Brazilian biomes that is currently ongoing and fuelled by landscape changes, expansion of agribusiness frontiers, deforestation, and fires.","[Bogoni, Juliano A.] Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Ecol Manejo & Conservacao Fauna Silvestre LEM, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Carvalho-Rocha, Vitor] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-88037000 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [da Silva, Pedro Giovani] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Programa Posgrad Ecol Conservacao & Manejo Sida S, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Bogoni, JA (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Ecol Manejo & Conservacao Fauna Silvestre LEM, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",bogoni@usp.br; vc87rox@gmail.com; pedrogiovanidasilva@yahoo.com.br,"Bogoni, Juliano/HLX-7986-2023; de Carvalho Rocha, Vitor/C-7590-2019; da Silva, Pedro Giovani/F-7605-2014","da Silva, Pedro Giovani/0000-0002-0702-9186","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2018-05970-1, 2019-11901-5]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES) [001]; CAPES [001, 88882.316025/2019-01]",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"JAB is supported by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) postdoctoral fellowship, via grants 2018-05970-1 and 2019-11901-5.

To address this problem, several methods have been developed, mainly in the context of data dimensionality reduction. One of these methods, Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction, has so far mainly been applied to case-control studies. In this study, we evaluate the power of Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction for quantitative traits to detect gene-gene interactions (epistasis) in the presence of error-free and noisy data. Considered sources of error are genotyping errors, missing genotypes, phenotypic mixtures and genetic heterogeneity. Our simulation study encompasses a variety of settings with varying minor allele frequencies and genetic variance for different epistasis models. On each simulated data, we have performed Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction in two ways: with and without adjustment for main effects of (known) functional SNPs. In line with binary trait counterparts, our simulations show that the power is lowest in the presence of phenotypic mixtures or genetic heterogeneity compared to scenarios with missing genotypes or genotyping errors. In addition, empirical power estimates reduce even further with main effects corrections, but at the same time, false-positive percentages are reduced as well. In conclusion, phenotypic mixtures and genetic heterogeneity remain challenging for epistasis detection, and careful thought must be given to the way important lower-order effects are accounted for in the analysis.

They are highly diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of species. Such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be potential hosts of a large variety of viruses. Bats are the only group of mammals capable of sustained flight, which enables them to disseminate the viruses they harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission. This article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of >30 CoVs with complete genomes sequenced, and many more if those without genome sequences are included. Among the four CoV genera, only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. As a whole, both alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been detected from bats in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia; but alphaCoVs seem to be more widespread than betaCoVs, and their detection rate is also higher. For betaCoVs, only those from subgenera Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Hibecovirus have been detected in bats. Most notably, horseshoe bats are the reservoir of SARS-CoV, and several betaCoVs from subgenus Merbecovirus are closely related to MERS-CoV. In addition to the interactions among various bat species themselves, bat-animal and bat-human interactions, such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in Southern China, are important for interspecies transmission of CoVs and may lead to devastating global outbreaks.","[Wong, Antonio C.

Nevertheless, BA still suffers from several problems such as poor exploration search, falling into local optima, and has many parameters that need to be controlled appropriately. Consequently, many researchers have proposed different techniques to handle such problems. However, there is a lack of systematic review on BA which could shed light on its variants. In the literature, several review papers have been reported, however, such studies were neither systematic nor comprehensive enough. Most studies did not report specifically which components of BA was modified. The range of improvements made to the BA varies, which often difficult for any enhancement to be accomplished if not properly addressed. Given such limitations, this study aims to review and analyse the recent variants of latest improvements in BA for optimal feature selection. The study has employed a standard systematic literature review method on four scientific databases namely, IEEE Xplore, ACM, Springer, and Science Direct. As a result, 147 research publications over the last ten years have been collected, investigated, and summarized. Several critical and significant findings based on the literature reviewed were reported in this paper which can be used as a guideline for the scientists in the future to do further research.","[Al-Dyani, Wafa Zubair; Ahmad, Farzana Kabir; Kamaruddin, Siti Sakira] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Arts & Sci, Sch Comp, Sintok 06010, Malaysia; [Al-Dyani, Wafa Zubair] Hadhramout Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Hadhramout, Yemen",Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Ahmad, FK (corresponding author), Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Arts & Sci, Sch Comp, Sintok 06010, Malaysia.;Al-Dyani, WZ (corresponding author), Hadhramout Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Hadhramout, Yemen.",wafazb1084@gmail.com; farzana58@uum.edu.my,"AHMAD, FARZANA/AFS-1611-2022","KABIR AHMAD, FARZANA/0000-0002-0374-6559",,,,,191,3,4,2,34,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1088-467X,1571-4128,,INTELL DATA ANAL,Intell.

Bats are an ideal model for studying trophic niche differentiation among species because of their high taxonomic and ecological diversities, as well as their special life history traits. Although many factors can affect bat trophic niches, few studies have combined multiple factors to investigate the influences on bat trophic niches. In this study, we analyzed the summer diet and potential influencing factors of five sympatric rhinolophid bats in southwestern China: Rhinolophus macrotis, Rhinolophus osgoodi, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus affinis, and Rhinolophus pusillus. All five species mainly fed on Lepidopteran and Dipteran insects, with a large trophic niche breadth for each species and a low degree of dietary overlap. With the exception of R. affinis and R. pusillus, significant differences in diet composition were detected among species, which indicated relatively low interspecific competition. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that both echolocation calls and body size significantly affected interspecific diet differentiation, while wing morphology and bite force had relatively weak effects. This study suggests that the combined effects of multiple factors may drive trophic niche differentiation among five rhinolophid bat species in the study area.","[Dai, Wentao; Zhang, Lin; Li, Jun; Leng, Haixia; Jin, Longru; Sun, Keping; Feng, Jiang] Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Prov Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Utili, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Dai, Wentao; Sun, Keping] Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Li, Aoqiang] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Chang, Yang] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tong; Li, Zhongle; Feng, Jiang] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Changchun, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China; Central China Normal University; Northeast Agricultural University - China; Jilin Agricultural University,"Jin, LR; Sun, KP (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Prov Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Utili, Changchun, Peoples R China.;Sun, KP (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun, Peoples R China.",jinlr915@nenu.edu.cn; sunkp129@nenu.edu.cn,,,,,,,86,4,5,12,59,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Mammalian home range size has been linked to body size and diet, but these studies were based predominantly on terrestrial species and most specifically excluded bats. As the only group of flying mammals, bats experience distinctly different constraints on movement, and hence home range. However, despite their diversity, relatively little is known about the home ranges of bats, and this is the first global review assessing correlates of their home range size. Our hypothesis is that home range will be impacted by different ecological conditions experienced by the bats and by the biological traits of the bats themselves. We performed a meta-analysis based on published data for 81 bat species to identify variables that contribute most to home range size. Sex, wing loading, functional group, colony size, dietary class, distance from the equator (latitudinal region), habitat type, and the interaction between habitat type and latitudinal region were all important explanatory variables. Wing loading was positively correlated with home range size-while females, open-air foragers, large colony sizes, and bats in temperate regions consistently had large home ranges. Understanding the correlates of home range has important implications, for example, for bat conservation and for assessing the risk of spillover of zoonotic pathogens from bats to humans and livestock. Bat home range size is reliably influenced by ecological variables and biological traits. Larger colony sizes are linked with larger home ranges. Home range size is positively influenced by an increasing need for open areas while foraging. More pronounced seasonal variation at higher latitudes may have a greater influence on seasonal adjustments in temperate bat movements than tropical bats.

Ecologists have long used the physical linkage between morphology and energy balance to explain why the body size and shape of many organisms vary across climatic gradients, e.g., why larger endotherms are more common in colder regions. However, few modeling exercises have aimed at investigating this link from first principles. Body size evolution in bats contrasts with the patterns observed in other endotherms, probably because physical constraints on flight limit morphological adaptations. Here, we develop a biophysical model based on heat transfer and aerodynamic principles to investigate energy constraints on morphological evolution in bats. Our biophysical model predicts that the energy costs of thermoregulation and flight, respectively, impose upper and lower limits on the relationship of wing surface area to body mass (S-MR), giving rise to an optimal S-MR at which both energy costs are minimized. A comparative analysis of 278 species of bats supports the model's prediction that S-MR evolves toward an optimal shape and that the strength of selection is higher among species experiencing greater energy demands for thermoregulation in cold climates. Our study suggests that energy costs modulate the mode of morphological evolution in bats-hence shedding light on a long-standing debate over bats' conformity to ecogeographical patterns observed in other mammals-and offers a procedure for investigating complex macroecological patterns from first principles.","[Rubalcaba, Juan G.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Rubalcaba, Juan G.; Castro, Mario G.; Amado, Talita F.; Olalla-Tarraga, Miguel A.] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Madrid 28933, Spain; [Gouveia, Sidney F.] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Ecol, BR-49100000 Sergipe, Brazil; [Villalobos, Fabricio] Inst Ecol AC, Red Biol Evolut, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Cruz-Neto, Ariovaldo P.] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Dept Biodiversidade, BR-13506900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Martinez, Pablo A.] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Biol, BR-49100000 Sergipe, Brazil; [Navas, Carlos A.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencia, Dept Fisiol, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Dobrovolski, Ricardo] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, BR-40170115 Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Felizola Diniz-Filho, Jose Alexandre] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil",McGill University; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidade Federal de Sergipe; Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Federal de Sergipe; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal da Bahia; Universidade Federal de Goias,"Rubalcaba, JG (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.;Rubalcaba, JG (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Madrid 28933, Spain.",jg.rubalcaba@gmail.com,"Olalla-Tárraga, Miguel/ABE-7880-2020; Rubalcaba, Juan/ABD-1339-2021; Martinez, Pablo/R-9374-2017; Dobrovolski, Ricardo/B-2580-2013; Amado, Talita/Y-5710-2019; Gouveia, Sidney/GQP-0892-2022; Navas, Carlos/B-2138-2013; Gouveia, Sidney/G-6438-2013; Villalobos, Fabricio/J-6246-2012","Olalla-Tarraga, Miguel Angel/0000-0001-5346-4528; Dobrovolski, Ricardo/0000-0002-8775-5486; Gil Castro, Mario/0000-0003-3682-9446; Navas, Carlos/0000-0002-9859-0568; Rubalcaba, Juan G./0000-0003-4646-070X; Gouveia, Sidney/0000-0003-4941-7440; Villalobos, Fabricio/0000-0002-5230-2217","European Union [843094]; National Institute of Science and Technology-Ecology, Evolution and Conservation of Biodiversity (INCT-EEC-Bio, CNPq/FAPEG), Brazil [380733/2017-0]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [EAE - 88881.198223/2018-01]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [843094] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)","European Union(European Union (EU)); National Institute of Science and Technology-Ecology, Evolution and Conservation of Biodiversity (INCT-EEC-Bio, CNPq/FAPEG), Brazil; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions)","We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and effort toward improving our manuscript.

The primary objective was to measure internal and external characteristics of caves and assess differences between maternity roosts and unused sites in summer, and between hibernacula and unused sites in winter. Hibernating clusters of Ozark big-eared bats occurred in the coldest regions of the coldest caves. Maternity clusters occurred at locations with temperatures cooler than those found near solitary bats and random points. No relationship was found between patterns of roost selection and relative humidity. We could not differentiate between used and unused caves during summer or winter using surface habitat variables (percent of land-use types, length of lotic habitat, and distance to nearest pond and building) within a 3-km radius of each cave.","OKLAHOMA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, OKLAHOMA COOPERAT FISH & WILDLIFE RES UNIT, STILLWATER, OK 74078 USA; OKLAHOMA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, US NATL BIOL SERV, OKLAHOMA COOPERAT FISH & WILDLIFE RES UNIT, STILLWATER, OK 74078 USA; OKLAHOMA STATE UNIV, DEPT AGRON, STILLWATER, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,,,,,,,,,37,44,46,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2328-5540,,,WILDLIFE SOC B,Wildl.

Body size is associated with many aspects of the life history, ecology and physiology of animals. Within a species, body size can vary substantially across space and time, and the mechanisms generating these patterns have been the focus of evolutionary and ecology research. 2. Bergmann's rule predicts a negative relationship between body size and temperature across the geographic range of endothermic animals; larger animals have a lower surface to volume ratio, which would allow for greater heat conservation. Despite the broad support for this pattern, its underlying mechanisms are heavily debated. Numerous alternative explanations have been proposed to explain why larger animals are found in colder climates and vice versa, including heat dissipation, environmental seasonality and resource availability. 3. We used the Pallid bat, Antrozous pallidus, as a model to evaluate Bergmannian size patterns and the relative support for major explanatory hypotheses of geographic body size variation. We tested the hypothesis that geographic size variation is predicted by productivity, as opposed to seasonality, heat conservation or dissipation, or some combination of these processes. Additionally, we investigated the potential ecomorphological consequences of size variation in Pallid bats by determining if skull shape (an indicator of bite performance) varies with size. 4. Whereas we did find that Pallid bat populations in northern latitudes are composed of larger individuals, our results suggest that net primary productivity and, to a lesser extent heat conservation, best explain size variation throughout the western range of this species. We also found that skull shape in Pallid bats changes in tandem with skull size, with larger bats having cranial traits associated with greater bite force production. 5. The results of our study indicate that variation in resource availability may be a key factor underlying spatial patterns in size, morphology and, possibly, feeding performance within wide-ranging bat species.","[Kelly, Rochelle M.; Santana, Sharlene E.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Burke Museum Nat Hist & Culture, Seattle, WA USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kelly, RM; Santana, SE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",rmkelly@uw.edu; ssantana@uw.edu,,,Seattle Chapter of the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS),Seattle Chapter of the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS),"We would like to thank the Los Angeles County Museum, the Museum of Southwestern Biology, the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and the Puget Sound Museum for specimen loans.

Forests, particularly in the eastern United States, provide prime foraging habitats for bats but can be heavily impacted by non-native plants, which may alter arthropod diversity and abundance, as well as vegetative structure. To investigate the associations between non-native plants and insect abundance, vegetative structure, and, consequently, bat activity, we performed vegetation surveys, insect trapping, and acoustic monitoring at 23 forested plots in northern New Jersey, USA. We predicted that non-native vegetation would either positively influence bat activity by increasing structural openness (thus, facilitating flight) or negatively influence bat activity by lowering the abundance of putative prey. We also hypothesized that vegetative characteristics, and therefore non-native vegetation, impact bats differently depending on their foraging habitat preferences. The percent of non-native cover of the ground and midstory vegetative layers of our study plots ranged from 0 to 92.92% (x = 46.94 +/- 5.77 SE) and was significantly correlated with structural vegetative characteristics, such as midstory clutter (beta = 0.01 +/- 0.006 SE), but not putative prey abundance (beta = -0.81 +/- 2.57 SE). Generalized linear models with only vegetative characteristics best predicted overall bat activity and foraging, which were greatest in areas with a high percent non-native vegetation and low midstory clutter. Although percent non-native vegetation and midstory clutter were also significant effects for bats that prefer to forage in open areas, neither vegetative characteristics nor prey abundance were significant effects for clutter-loving bats. Such findings suggest that vegetative structure is more important than prey availability for predicting overall insectivorous bat activity, but other factors, such as foraging strategy and life history traits, can impact how bat guilds respond to non-native vegetation. Therefore, more research is required to reveal additional mechanisms by which non-native plants impact bats.","[Mark, Morgan; Kerwin, Kathleen; Maslo, Brooke] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Drake, Evan] Felician Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Rutherford, NJ 07070 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Felician University,"Maslo, B (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",morgan.mark@rutgers.edu; brooke.maslo@rutgers.edu,,"Mark, Morgan/0000-0003-1358-1134",National Park Service Cooperative Research and Training Grant,National Park Service Cooperative Research and Training Grant,"Special thanks to Park Biologist Bob Masson, Park Law Enforcement, for facilitating field surveys, and to Justin Martinez and Kelly Faller for assisting with data collection.
